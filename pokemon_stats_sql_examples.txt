AI: To find out which Pokemon can learn Thunderbolt, I need to query the database for move learnsets.
Thought: I'll use the PokemonStatsSQL tool to search for Pokemon that can learn Thunderbolt.
Action: PokemonStatsSQL

Note: Many more Pokemon can learn Thunderbolt, but this list is limited to 10 examples.
Thought: The database has provided a list of Pokemon that can learn Thunderbolt.
Final Answer: Many Pokemon can learn the move Thunderbolt, as it's a widely distributed Electric-type move. Here are some notable examples:

2. Electric-type Pokemon like Magnemite, Magneton, Voltorb, and Electrode
3. Other Electric-types such as Electabuzz and Jolteon

Example 3:
Human: What type advantages does Psychic have?
AI: To answer this question about Psychic-type advantages, I need to query the type effectiveness database.
Thought: I'll use the PokemonStatsSQL tool to get information about Psychic-type effectiveness against other types.
Action: PokemonStatsSQL
Action Input: Show the effectiveness of Psychic-type moves against all other types.
Observation: Final Answer: Psychic-type moves have the following effectiveness:
Super effective (2x damage) against:
- Fighting
- Poison
Not very effective (0.5x damage) against:
- Steel
- Psychic
No effect (0x damage) against:
- Dark
Normal effectiveness (1x damage) against all other types.
Thought: The database has provided the type effectiveness information for Psychic-type moves.
Final Answer: Psychic-type moves have the following type advantages and disadvantages:

Advantages (Super effective, 2x damage):
1. Fighting-type Pokemon
2. Poison-type Pokemon

Disadvantages (Not very effective, 0.5x damage):
1. Steel-type Pokemon
2. Other Psychic-type Pokemon

Additionally, Psychic-type moves have no effect (0x damage) on Dark-type Pokemon, which is a significant weakness.

Psychic moves deal normal damage (1x) to all other types not mentioned above.

This type matchup makes Psychic-type moves particularly strong against Fighting and Poison types, while being less useful against Steel, other Psychic types, and completely ineffective against Dark types. Trainers should consider these strengths and weaknesses when using Psychic-type Pokemon or moves in battles.
