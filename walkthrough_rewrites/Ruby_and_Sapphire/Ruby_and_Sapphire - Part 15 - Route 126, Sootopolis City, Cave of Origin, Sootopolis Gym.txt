**Route 126**  
- Access Sootopolis City underwater; trainers such as Swimmer Barry (Gyarados, Lv. 35) await.

**Catch Up with Steven**

**Cave of Origin**  
- Follow the straightforward path downwards:
  - **1F**: Move clockwise to the NE ladder.
  - **B1F**: Follow the tunnel to the W ladder.
  - **B2F**: Move south to find the next ladder.
  - **B3F**: Find HM07 (Waterfall) in the NW corner; then go NE down the ladder.
  - **B4F**: Approach the pool to trigger the encounter with Groudon (R) or Kyogre (S).

**Battle Strategies**:  
- **Groudon (R)**: Use Grass and Ice moves; avoid Water moves due to Drought ability.  
- **Kyogre (S)**: Use Grass and Electric moves; avoid Fire moves due to Drizzle ability.

**Aftermath**  
- After defeating the super-ancient Pokémon, return to the Gym where Steven thanks you. Wallace is back at the Gym.

**Sootopolis Gym**

  - Puzzle 1: Move →1, ↑1, ←2, ↑1, →1.
  - Puzzle 2: Move ←3, ↑2, →2, ↓1, →3, ↓1, →1, ↑2, ←3.
  - Puzzle 3: Follow a longer path to reveal the final stairway.

- **Luvdisc (Lv. 40)**: Weak but can inflict confusion. 
- **Whiscash (Lv. 42)**: Vulnerable to Grass moves.
- **Sealeo (Lv. 40)**: Weak to Fighting and Rock moves.
