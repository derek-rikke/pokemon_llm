**Pokémon Yellow Walkthrough: Part 1 - Pallet Town**

**Introduction:**
- Start the game by selecting "New Game" on the title screen. Choose your character's name and your rival's name from preset options or create your own.

**Pallet Town Overview:**
- Your journey begins in Pallet Town, which has three main buildings: your house (west), your rival's house (east), and Professor Oak's Lab (south). The north leads to Route 1.

**Key Items:**
- **Potion**: Found in your PC at home.
- **Pokédex**: Given by Professor Oak after he receives his parcel.
- **Town Map**: Obtained from Daisy in your rival's house after getting the Pokédex.

**Gameplay Steps:**
1. **Home (2F)**: Withdraw the Potion from your PC, then head downstairs.
2. **Home (1F)**: Talk to your mom, who informs you that Professor Oak is looking for you. Exit the house.
3. **Encounter with Oak**: Head to the tall grass north of town. Professor Oak appears and catches a wild Pikachu.
4. **Professor Oak's Lab**: Oak offers you the caught Pikachu as your first Pokémon. Your rival will challenge you to a battle immediately after.

**Rival Battle 1:**
- **Battle Details**: You and your rival each send out a Level 5 Pokémon (Pikachu vs. Eevee).
- **Strategy**: Use "Fight" to attack. If your HP is low, use the Potion from your inventory. The outcome of this battle influences Eevee's evolution later.
- **Reward**: Defeating your rival earns you $175 and your Pikachu gains experience, leveling up to Level 6. 

**Next Steps:**
- After the battle, Pikachu will follow you. Head north to Route 1 to continue your adventure.
