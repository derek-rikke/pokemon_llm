Steer Clear of the Grunts
Normally, visitors to the mountaintop would be able to head south through
Jagged Pass
to reach
Lavaridge Town
. But Team Magma and Team Aqua are locked in battle all over the summit, including the entrance to the mountain pass. Let their Pokémon fight it out while you climb up north to the crater.
West of the stairway, you find
Aqua Leader
Archie
R
/
Magma Leader
Maxie
S
in a skirmish against a group of opposing Grunts. You're only here for
Cozmo
's Meteorite, though, so slip past the battle and work your way to the northwest.
Spotted!
There is a single Grunt ahead standing guard, and you are quickly drawn into battle. But you're more than a match for one lowly Grunt, so finish him off quickly and continue northward.
Challenge Accepted!
Make your way farther north and you'll be stopped by
Tabitha
R
/
Matt
S
, who isn't about to let you pass by so easily!

With his defeat, Maxie
R
/Archie
S
grudgingly gives up his plans for Mt. Chimney, but reassures you that his team will still prevail. He flees along with his subordinates, a moment before Archie
R
/Maxie
S
appears. He thanks you for your help, and pledges to continue fighting against the villainous team's destructive plans. Once he leaves, inspect the machine to retrieve the
Meteorite
for
Professor Cozmo
.
Jagged Pass
Jagged Pass
Jagged Pass
was formed as the result of an ancient volcanic eruption. When the lava cooled, it proved to be suitable for an alternate route to the summit. Though not necessary for southward travel, the
Acro Bike
is needed to scale the rough terrain when traveling northward.

lying near a tree. Jump the ledge to the south, then head all the way to the west and jump another ledge. Check the corner here for a hidden
Great Ball
, then continue south past Picnicker Diana to reach the exit. This leads to the southwest part of
Route 112
, just outside
Lavaridge Town

Lavaridge Town
Lavaridge Town
Nestled at the foot of
Mt. Chimney
,
Lavaridge Town
is a welcome sight for travelers and tourists alike. It is well-known throughout
Hoenn
for its soothing hot springs, said to cure any ailment, and also features a specialty shop that sells bitter but beneficial
herbs
for Pokémon. The
Lavaridge Gym
, fourth in the
Hoenn League
, stands in the southwest part of town.

Pokémon Center and Hot Springs
The building's back door leads to the steamy hot springs. Take a dip if you wish, and use the Itemfinder to locate an
Ice Heal
hidden in the waters. Afterward, use the PC to organize your party so that you are carrying no more than five Pokémon. Step outside and talk to the old woman near the sand baths, and she offers you a Pokémon Egg to take with you on your travels!
Herb Shop
At the
Herb Shop
, a woman sells
herbal medicines
for Pokémon. These natural remedies are just as effective as their traditional counterparts and less expensive, but their bitter taste make them difficult for Pokémon to take, leaving them less
friendly
toward you. As
Max Revives
cannot be purchased anywhere, it may be useful to buy a few
Revival Herbs
to have in case of an emergency.

Lavaridge Gym
Lavaridge Gym, 1F
Lavaridge Gym, B1F
Lavaridge Town Pokémon Gym
Leader: Flannery
One with a fiery passion that burns!
Like the name suggests, the
Lavaridge Gym
specializes in
Fire-type
Pokémon.
Grass
-,
Bug
-,
Ice
-, and
Steel-type
Pokémon are most vulnerable to their scorching attacks, while
Water
,
Ground
, and
Rock
moves will give you the upper hand.
Wingull
and
Pelipper
are great Pokémon to bring to this Gym; not only are they Water types, but as
Flying
types they also have an advantage against Battle Girl Sadie's
Meditite
. The humid Gym features two floors; stepping on a pool of water will cause you to fall to the basement, and doing the same there will send you back to the first floor atop a geyser.
There are two puddles in the first room. Approach the one to the right to battle Kindler Cole, then step on the other to fall to the basement. Step on the other puddle there to ride the geyser to the southwest part of 1F. Cooltrainer Zane hides in the northeast pool, while you can advance by stepping on the northwest puddle. This part of B1F has only one geyser leading back upstairs. In 1F's western room, Kindler Axle can be found in the puddle to the east while you can proceed by stepping on the puddle to the left. Once again, the only option in this area is to take the geyser back to 1F. In the northwest room, approach the northwest pool to fight Battle Girl Sadie before falling through the northeast pool. Ride the geyser back upstairs, to the northeast room. Here, the northwest puddle hides the last Gym Trainer, Kindler Andy, while the southwest pool hides the path forward. Go south and ride the final geyser up to the Gym Leader's room.
Flannery
has only recently begun serving as Gym Leader, and is intent on proving her worth. Given the chance, her Pokémon can unleash powerful moves that can reduce a challenger's party to cinders.
Sunny Day
gives a 50% power boost to all Fire attacks, which makes her Pokémon's strongest move,
Overheat
, even more devastating. Its only drawback is that it harshly lowers the user's
Special Attack
after each use, but once is usually enough! In addition, the harsh sunlight temporarily cuts the power of Water attacks in half.

After the battle, Flannery awards you the

, which ensures obedience of all Pokémon up to level 50 and enables the use of
Strength
in the field. She also hands out
TM50
(
Overheat
) as a prize. Fall through the other pool and head south to take the geyser to the entrance room. Outside, May/Brendan is impressed that you defeated the Lavaridge Gym. Since you are obviously capable, she/he hands you the
Go-Goggles
, which allow you to explore the desert of
Route 111
in spite of the raging sandstorm. Your friend then heads off to challenge
Norman
at the
Petalburg Gym
.
