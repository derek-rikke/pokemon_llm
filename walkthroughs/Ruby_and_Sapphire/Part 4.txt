Slateport City

Pokémon Contest
Hall
to the
Oceanic Museum
, there's plenty to marvel at in this seaside metropolis.

Slateport Market
The
open-air market
hosts numerous vendors peddling rare goods. A man near the southern entrance hints that you'll find even more bargains after obtaining
TM43
(
Secret Power
). Permanent stat-boosting
Vitamins
can be purchased from the Energy Guru. The red-clad clerk standing next to him will give your lead Pokémon an
Effort Ribbon
if it has been well-trained. Also after obtaining TM43, another clerk appears from whom additional copies of that and
TM10
(
Hidden Power
) may be purchased.
Pokémon Fan Club
The
Pokémon Fan Club
can be found just north of the Market. If your lead Pokémon is
friendly
enough toward you, you can receive a
Soothe Bell
from the woman near the back wall. Visit with the club's chairman to have him examine your lead Pokémon's condition. If any of its five Contest stats are high enough, he will reward you with a special item—a
Red
,
Blue
,
Pink
,
Green
, or
Yellow Scarf
. When held, these items boost their respective stat during the Appeal Round of a Pokémon Contest.
Name Rater
North of the Fan Club building is the home of the
Name Rater
. This man has the power to evaluate and change your Pokémon's nicknames as often as you'd like. However, he cannot change a Pokémon's nickname if it first belonged to someone else.
Pokémon Contest Hall
The local
Pokémon Contest
Hall stands in the northwest corner of the city. This building hosts only
Hyper Rank
Contests. In order to participate, you'll need to first clear a Super Rank Contest in the
Fallarbor
Contest Hall, and a Normal Rank Contest in the
Verdanturf
Contest Hall before that. But even though you can't take part in a Contest just yet, there are still items to collect inside. Speak to the little girl near the entrance to receive a
Pokéblock Case
, which holds up to 40
candies
that can be fed to a Pokémon to increase its
condition
for Contests. In addition, you can visit the back room and talk to the Sailor here to receive
TM41
(
Torment
).
Slateport Harbor
The Harbor is located in the city's northeast district. Since construction is not yet complete on the new ferry, there is little to do here at the moment.
Stern's Shipyard
Inside
Stern's Shipyard
, you find
the captain
's assistant,
Dock
, looking over plans for the
new ferry
that is under construction here. Though Stern is nowhere to be found, Dock asks that you deliver the
Devon Goods
to him.
Oceanic Museum
At first, it is impossible to enter the
Oceanic Museum
because of the
Team Magma
R
/
Team Aqua
S
Grunts lined up outside. But by the time you visit the shipyard, the group has made its way into the building. Pay the
$
50 entrance fee to follow them inside. Those that can't afford it will be mistaken as part of "the group that came in earlier", and allowed in for free.
The Grunts are more interested in the exhibits than battling with you, so speak to them in an effort to gauge their intentions. A Grunt near the entrance is shocked to see you; it's the same guy you fought back in
Rusturf Tunnel
! He's learned not to mess with you, and begs forgiveness with
TM46
(
Thief
) before fleeing the scene.
Go upstairs to find
Captain Stern
, examining a display in the lower-right corner. Before you can hand over the
Devon Goods
for his new ferry, you are attacked by two Grunts! Defeat one after the other to save the captain and complete the delivery for
Mr. Stone
. Shocked at their failure, the two begin to plan their next move when a stranger appears. It's their boss,
Magma Leader
Maxie
R
/
Aqua Leader
Archie
S
! He wonders aloud why you would want to hinder their plans, but forgives you as being too young to understand their ideals. As the group departs, he warns against interfering with their future plans.
Route 110
Route 110
The lengthy
Route 110
connects two of
Hoenn
's largest cities,
Slateport
and
Mauville
, and also links back to
Route 103
. All pedestrians are restricted to the lower path, which features the mysterious
Trick House
. After obtaining a Bike, you can speed through the route on
Seaside Cycling Road
.

Finding the Trick Master
When you step inside, you can't shake the feeling that someone is watching you. The mischievous Trick Master is hiding somewhere! Search the entire room until you find him, when he accepts your challenge and disappears. Certain field moves are required for most of the mazes, so you will need to return later to complete the rest.
Inside the Maze
Once he leaves, examine the scroll on the wall to find a secret passage that leads to a devious maze. Navigate the maze and battle Trainers as you search for a rolled-up scroll with a secret code. Reach the back of the maze and examine the hanging scroll. Inscribe the code on the hidden door to open it. There's no going back, so be sure to find everything the maze has to offer before entering the next room!
Trick Master's Room
The Trick Master waits here for all challengers. Speak to him to receive your reward, then leave through the exit in the north wall. After the last challenge, you can find a hidden
Nugget
where the Trick Master had stood.
Rival Battle 2
Go east from the Trick House and pass beneath Cycling Road. Turn north and continue on until you meet
May
/
Brendan
again. It seems like ages since you last met, so prove to your friend how far you've come as a Trainer!

After the battle, May/Brendan hands you the

Mauville City
.
Route 103 (optional)
Go to the left of the Trick House. Back to
Route 103
!. This is the eastern side of the route. It won't take you back to
Oldale Town
before you earn more
Badges
, but there are a lot of Trainers here. It's a good idea to battle them all— it's excellent training for your upcoming Gym battle.
