Fortree City
Fortree City
Fortree City
is located in an old-growth forest with many towering trees. These ancient arbors are so large that the residents were able to build cozy homes among their branches. The
Fortree Gym
can be found in the heart of the city, and a shop offering Secret Base decorations can be found in the southeast part of town.

Running Errands
Speak to the Pokémon Breeder in the northeast house to see his
Wingull
fly off on an errand. Return later to see if it's successful!
Reveal Your Hidden Power
The north-northwest house belongs to an old woman. Speak to her to take a quiz. She holds a coin in her hand, and asks in which one you think it's hidden. Guess correctly
three times in a row
to receive
TM10
(
Hidden Power
)! This unique attack is listed as a
Normal-type
move, but its type and power vary depending on the Pokémon using it.
Time for a Trade
The little girl in the northwest house wants a
Pikachu
. If you happen to catch one in the nearby
Safari Zone
, she'll give you her
Skitty
in return. Skitty arrives holding a
Glitter Mail
.
Route 120
With an invisible object blocking the Gym, there's nothing else to do in the city. Go east to
Route 120
to find Steven on the northern bridge. It seems that another unseen object blocks the way forward, but luckily he has a way to solve this mystery. He puts on the
Devon Scope
, a high-tech piece of eyewear that reveals invisible objects. Sure enough, they reveal a
Kecleon
in front of you; catch or defeat the Pokémon to clear the bridge. Pleased with your actions, Steven allows you to keep the device. With the Devon Scope in hand, you can chase off the Kecleon outside the Gym, so head back into town to win your next Badge!
Fortree City
Fortree Gym
Fortree Gym
Fortree City Pokémon Gym
Leader: Winona
The bird user taking flight into the world.
The
Fortree Gym
specializes in
Flying-type
Pokémon, which take serious damage from
Electric
,
Rock
, and
Ice
moves. The Gym is fairly straightforward, with a single path leading up to the Gym Leader's lofty perch. The only obstacles are turnstiles, some of which can only be spun in certain directions. Pass through the first two turnstiles to reach Bird Keeper Jared, and Picnicker Kylee beyond him. Defeat Kylee and spin the second turnstile the opposite direction to continue on. Go north to find the next two turnstiles. Go north past the L-shaped one, and spin the T-shaped one in a counter-clockwise direction. Spin the third clockwise and loop around to pass through the fourth turnstile. Continue past Camper Terrell to find the final three turnstiles. Go east through the fifth, then northeast through the sixth. Before moving on, spin the most recent one back to its starting position. Go south through the final turnstile before looping around past Bird Keeper Will to reach the Gym Leader.
Winona
starts off with
Swellow
, which tends to lead with
Double Team
to raise its
evasiveness
. This can become increasingly problematic, so use super-effective moves to defeat it quickly. Her
Pelipper
takes massive damage from
Electric
attacks.
Rock
moves are also effective, but Rock Pokémon should be wary of its
Water Gun
.
Skarmory
has several resistances and a high physical
Defense
, which may rise even higher due to
Steel Wing
.
Sand-Attack
makes it harder to hit, while
Aerial Ace
's perfect
accuracy
lets it reliably land a hit. Due to its
Dragon
typing, her
Altaria
takes only normal damage from Electric moves. Rock moves will be more effective, and Ice moves are greater still. It can target unsuspecting Electric types with
Earthquake
, and can raise its
Attack
and
Speed
with
Dragon Dance
.

Upon her defeat,
Winona
awards you the
Feather Badge
, which ensures obedience from all Pokémon up to level 70 and enables the use of
Fly
in the field. This move allows you to instantly revisit any city or town you've previously explored. She also hands out
TM40
(
Aerial Ace
) as a prize.
Route 120
Route 120
The lengthy
Route 120
runs southeast from

to
Route 121
. The long grass makes great cover for Pokémon capable of camouflaging themselves. Two separate ruins,
Scorched Slab
and the
Ancient Tomb
, are located here.

Scorched Slab
Scorched Slab
is a cave jutting up out of the north lake. The entrance lies at water level, so the single chamber inside holds mostly water. At the far end of the cave, a small slab of rock holds a single bit of treasure,
TM11
(
Sunny Day
).
A Berry A Day
The route splits near its south end, with the western trail leading up to a plateau. Talk to the Beauty near the stairway and she'll give you one rare Berry every day. The kind of Berry received depends on the last digit of your
Trainer ID number
.

Ancient Tomb
The unusual arrangement of stones on the southwest plateau is known as the
Ancient Tomb
. It is believed to mark the resting place of a legendary Pokémon. But with the entrance sealed, you won't be able to investigate until later.
Route 121
Route 121

Safari Game
In a Safari Game, Trainers must use unconventional tactics to catch wild Pokémon. Rather than use your own Pokémon in battle, you are only allowed to throw
Pokéblocks
to entice the target, making it less likely to run; or go near, which makes the target easier to catch but more likely to run.
In addition, there are several Pokéblock feeders scattered throughout the park. Each feeder can accept a single Pokéblock at a time. Any Pokémon encountered in the feeder's range of five steps will have a Nature that is attracted to that type of Pokéblock. The feeder's effect dissipates after 100 steps are taken.

On 1F, talk to the old woman in the northeast corner. Concerned for your safety, she gives you a
Cleanse Tag
, which reduces the wild encounter rate when held by your lead Pokémon.
On 6F, pick up
TM30
(
Shadow Ball
) from the south side before falling through the nearby hole in the floor. On the south side of 5F, you find a
Lax Incense
, which boosts the holder's
evasiveness
by 5%. Fall through the next hole to return to 4F, where you find a
Sea Incense
. This item gives
Water
moves a 20% power boost when held. These Incenses also allow
Wobbuffet
,
Marill
, and
Azumarill
to produce
Wynaut
and
Azurill
Eggs at the Day Care.
Exterior
Reaching the summit means a long climb up the mountainside. Be sure to collect
TM48
(
Skill Swap
) and the
Max Potion
before moving on.
Summit
When you reach the summit, you are finally able to catch up to
Team Magma
R
/
Team Aqua
S
. Show no mercy to the three Grunts lining the path as you advance northward. Upon reaching the mountain's highest peak, you witness
Maxie
R
/
Archie
S
stealing the
Blue Orb
R
/
Red Orb
S
from its altar! Like your last meeting atop
Mt. Chimney
, he doesn't have much time to waste on you. He orders the rest of the team to
Slateport City
, to commandeer a submarine moored at the harbor there. He flees a moment later, and the elderly caretakers of the two Orbs then entrust the remaining
Red Orb
R
/
Blue Orb
S
to you, saying that the two Orbs belong together and must never be separated as they are now. The quickest way back to
Slateport
is to
Fly
there, otherwise you'll need to head south through
Route 123
.
Route 123
Route 123
Route 123
slopes downhill as it runs westward, from

back to

The

, are located near the route's west end. Talk to him to receive two Berries of the same name every day, chosen randomly:
Pomeg

Kelpsy
,
Qualot
,
Hondew
,
Grepa
,
Tamato
,
Cornn
,
Magost
,
Rabuta
, or
Nomel
.
The
Berry Master's wife
will give out a Berry each day as well, but the type depends on whether or not you tell her a special phrase. Most answers will result in a common type of Berry—
Cheri
,
Chesto
,
Pecha
,
Rawst
,
Aspear
,
Leppa
,
Oran
,
Persim
,
Lum
, or
Sitrus
—while certain answers will earn a rarer variety. After hearing all five phrases, she will hand out one common Berry every day.
