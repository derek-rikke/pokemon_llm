The hideout belonging to
Team Magma
R
/
Team Aqua
S
can be found in a cave to the northeast of
Lilycove
's beach. You'll need to storm their hideout in order to retrieve
Captain Stern
's submarine, so bring a party that can handle plenty of battles against them. When choosing your team, remember that Team Magma often uses
Fire
- and
Dark-type
Pokémon, while Team Aqua often uses
Water
- and Dark-type Pokémon.

Maxie
's misguided vision from becoming reality!

Climb out of the water and up the three stairways. At the top, a single Magma Grunt patrols around the hill. Battle him and climb the stairs to the north.
2F (west)
There are two warp panels in the northwest room; take the southern panel first to reach the southwest room and a
Max Elixir
. Warp back and take the other to reach the north-northwest room, and head downstairs to the submarine room.
Submarine room
Defeat the Magma Grunt in the northwest room, then climb the nearby stairs back to 2F.
2F (west)
In the north-central room, there is only a single warp panel, which leads to the southwest room. Pass by the two Magma Grunts and take the warp panel in the southwest. This leads to the east-central room, and another warp panel.
2F (east)
The previous warp panel leads to a small room with several more. Follow them in the correct order—left, center, right, right—to reach the interior room on 2F.
2F (west)
In
Maxie
's office, you'll find four items near the far wall. Two of them are actually
Electrode
in disguise, while the bottom-left item is a
Nugget
and the top-left item is a
Master Ball
! This type of Poké Ball will catch any wild Pokémon without fail, and is best used on hard-to-catch legendary Pokémon. Backtrack through the warp-filled hallway to 2F's southeast room, and step on the southeast warp panel. This transports you to the northeast room; take out the single Grunt and head down the stairs.
Submarine room
Pass by the two generators and take the northeast warp panel to the southeast area and a
Nest Ball
before warping back. Head southwest past another Grunt to the next warp panel; this one leads a short distance to the west. Go south to find one of the Magma Admins,
Tabitha
, standing at the water's edge. He's the only thing standing between you and stopping
Maxie
's getaway!

The battle lasted just long enough for
Maxie
to escape in his souped-up submarine. You've got to chase after him to the
Seafloor Cavern
, but you have no means of diving underwater like he can in his sub. For now, you'll have to keep to the surface. Head west then north and take the warp panel there back to the cave entrance and
Lilycove City
. The Grunt and his
Wailmer
blockade have disappeared from the beach, leaving you free to venture out into the eastern ocean.

Route 124, Surface
Route 124, Underwater
Route 124
holds all sorts of treasure, but most lie on the ocean floor far below. It's not possible to fully explore the area without
a certain field move
, so for now the route simply serves as a connector between
Lilycove
to the west,
Route 126
to the south, and
Mossdeep City
to the east.
