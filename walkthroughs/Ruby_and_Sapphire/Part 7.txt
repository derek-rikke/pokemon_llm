Meet Lanette
Inside the Pokémon Center, you find the PC in use by a woman named
Lanette
. She upgraded the previous version of the
Pokémon Storage System
, adding a user-friendly graphical interface, the ability to store over 400 Pokémon, and the ability to change the
wallpaper
of each Box. As she leaves, she invites you to visit her home on
Route 114
.
Move Maniac
The
Move Maniac
lives in the northwest house. This helpful guy knows every move a Pokémon can learn as it grows, and is able to teach forgotten moves to any Pokémon, for a price. He charges a single
Heart Scale
for each move relearned. While a few can be found on the beach as invisible items right now, you will need to wait until you encounter wild
Luvdisc
later on to be able to collect a more steady supply.
Route 114
Route 114
Pockmarked by fallen Meteorites, the lengthy
Route 114
leads up the mountainside to
Meteor Falls
. The
Fossil Maniac
lives up north, while
Lanette
's home stands on the water's edge.

Treasure-Hunting
Though it was possible to visit Route 115 when you first reached
Rustboro City
, by traveling to the area through Meteor Falls, you can now explore the route more thoroughly than before. Fight a few Trainers as you comb the hills for a
Great Ball
and a few Berries. You can also use the
Itemfinder
to uncover a
Heart Scale
on the beach. But where are the Pokémon? With no tall grass on the route's south side, the only species to be found are those that can be hooked with the
Old Rod
. Return once you can
Surf
outside of battle to reach the north side, where more Pokémon and items await!
