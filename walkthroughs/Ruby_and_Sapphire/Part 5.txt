Mauville Gym
Mauville Gym
Mauville City Pokémon Gym
Leader: Wattson
The cheerfully electrifying man!
The
Mauville Gym
specializes in
Electric-type
Pokémon. While Pokémon of this type are only vulnerable to
Ground-type
attacks, the secondary types of the Pokémon inside make
Fire
and
Fighting
moves useful as well. Keep your
Water
- and
Flying-type
Pokémon on the sidelines for now. The Gym features several electrical barriers, which can be turned on and off by stepping on thunderbolt-shaped switches. To reach the Gym Leader, simply step on the northwest switch.
Wattson
leads with his
Magnemite
, an
Electric
/
Steel
Pokémon. Due to its type combination, it is especially vulnerable to
Ground
moves. It can use
Thunder Wave
to paralyze the target, cutting its
Speed
and restricting its movement, and can further antagonize its target with
Supersonic
. Though his
Voltorb
's
Attack
is low, if left unchecked its
Rollout
move—a
Rock
attack—increases in power and can pose a danger to
Fire
Pokémon like
Combusken
. His third Pokémon,
Magneton
, likes to start with
Supersonic
to confuse its foe. All of his Pokémon know
SonicBoom
, a weak move but one that is guaranteed to deal 20 points of damage if it hits.

Pokémon Day Care
The
Pokémon Day Care
is a facility that raises Pokémon for busy Trainers. For a small fee, up to two Pokémon can be left here to be raised by the Day Care staff. During their stay, Pokémon will gradually level up and learn new moves. When two
compatible
Pokémon are left at the same time, you may return to find an
Egg
! Speak to the Day-Care Man and he will hint at the odds of finding one.

Whenever an Egg is found, the Day-Care Man will be standing farther away from the fence, eager to talk to you. Speak to him to receive the Egg, and carry it with you on your journey. The more you travel with an Egg, the faster the Pokémon inside will hatch.
