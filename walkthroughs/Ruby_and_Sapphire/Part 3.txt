Dewford Hall
Located to the north of the Pokémon Center, Dewford Hall is known as "Everyone's Information Exchange". Though Dewford is a tiny island community, when someone coins a
trendy phrase
here, it quickly spreads throughout the region. Speak to the boy outside the building to learn the coolest thing in cool right now; if you disagree, he offers a chance to change the current phrase, which the residents inside will quickly adopt.
Hook the Big One!
Speak to the Fisherman outside the Gym, and answer his question to receive the
Old Rod
. This low-end fishing rod can hook Pokémon from any body of water, so be sure to try it out everywhere!
Dewford Gym
Dewford Gym
Dewford Town Pokémon Gym
Leader: Brawly
A big wave in fighting!
The
Dewford Gym
specializes in
Fighting-type
Pokémon.
Flying
- and
Psychic-type
moves are the most effective here, so this is a great opportunity to train
Taillow
,
Wingull
, or
Ralts
. Keep your
Normal
-,
Rock
-, and
Dark-type
Pokémon out of the fray for now. The Gym is dimly lit when you first enter, but the building lights up bit by bit for each Gym Trainer you defeat. Once the Gym Leader is defeated, the entire Gym lights up completely.
Even with only two Pokémon,
Brawly
can be a tough opponent. Both his
Machop
and
Makuhita
have the
Guts
Ability, which boosts the Pokémon's
Attack
by 50% when afflicted by any status condition.
Bulk Up
allows the user to raise its Attack and
Defense
, and Machop can deal even more damage by lowering the target's Defense with
Leer
.

in the field. He also hands out

(

) as a prize.

Talk to
Mr. Briney
on the pier to inform him of your successful delivery, and the two of you, along with

Mr. Stone
still needs you to deliver the

to
Captain Stern
, so now it's on to
Slateport City
!

Route 108
Like with Routes

, there's no time to fully explore the area at the moment. There is little of interest on
Route 107
, but
Route 108
holds what remains of the half-sunken
Abandoned Ship
. Once you have access to
Surf
, you can fight some trainers and get some items.
