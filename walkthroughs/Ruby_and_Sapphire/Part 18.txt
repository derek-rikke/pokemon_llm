Walkthrough Text:
This is the Bulbapedia walkthrough for
Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire
.
These pages follow the original
Game Boy Advance

Hoenn
's most remote island, on the far eastern edge of the region. To get there, sail southward from
Mossdeep City
, then eastward through
Route 128
's narrow channel.

Ever Grande City
High above the ocean,
Ever Grande City
is lush with grass and flowers. The large waterfall makes it impossible to reach the city itself without a Pokémon able to
scale
the cascading waters. The island is divided by
Victory Road
, which runs through a large mountain at the center of the isle. Visit the Pokémon Center to make your preparations before braving this final challenge on the road to the
Pokémon League
.

Victory Road
, the long, tough trail through the mountainside, is the final challenge on the road to the
Pokémon League
. This grueling trail serves as a way to weed out all but the most determined Trainers. The field moves
Surf
,
Strength
,
Rock Smash
, and
Waterfall
are required to reach the other side, while
Flash
is optional. If you can make it through this daunting tunnel, you just might have what it takes to enter the
Hall of Fame
!

1F
Head north under the first two bridges and climb the north-northwest stairway. Turn east and cross over these next two bridges to reach a
Max Elixir
on a ledge to the east. Jump the ledge and head to the northwest, battling Cooltrainer Albert on the way. Climb the west-central stairway to battle Cooltrainer Hope in the northwest corner, and take the ladder down to B1F.
B1F
As this level is deeper underground, it's a good idea to use
Flash
to light the way. There are two boulders nearby; use
Strength
to move the first boulder westward and the second boulder eastward. This leads to a fork in the road. Take the northern path past cracked rocks, boulders, and Cooltrainer Shannon to reach the ladder in the southeast corner; this leads to a
PP Up
and a hidden
Ultra Ball
on 1F. Back on B1F, jump the nearby ledge and head north past Cooltrainer Samuel to find a
Full Restore
beyond some boulders and a cracked rock. Backtrack to the southeast ledge, then go west to reach the next ladder.
B2F
Go north to fight Cooltrainer Julie and
Surf
north across the water's edge. Climb the stairway, check the nook in the north wall for a hidden
Max Repel
, then take the northeast ladder to an isolated cliff on B1F, which holds
TM29
(
Psychic
). Back on B2F, head south to battle Cooltrainer Owen. After that, pass over the two bridges to fight Cooltrainer Caroline at the west end. Go north to find yourself at the top of a waterfall. Surf out to the northeast to battle
Cooltrainer Vito
and claim a
Full Heal
, then continue east to find a hidden
Elixir
atop the eastern waterfall. Turn around and ride down the western waterfall before turning east to reach the next ladder.
B1F
Jumping the ledge to the west leads only to a battle with Cooltrainer Michelle. Head southeast instead and use Strength and Rock Smash to clear a way to the final ladder.
1F
Cross over the final bridge and head north to fight Cooltrainer Edgar. Go a short distance northward and turn the corner to come within view of the exit, just as
Wally
catches up to you. After a short conversation, you find that the sickly, weak-willed kid you met back in
Petalburg City
is no more. In his place stands a confident Trainer, ready to show off how much training he's done!
VS Wally
Wally leads with his
Altaria
, a
Dragon
/
Flying
type that is especially vulnerable to
Ice
attacks. It can raise its
Attack
and
Speed
with
Dragon Dance
, so use super-effective moves to take it down before it becomes a major threat.
Delcatty
may be his weakest Pokémon, but it can still cause problems with
Sing
,
Charm
, and its
Cute Charm
Ability. Its stats aren't very threatening, but knock it out quickly to avoid these pitfalls. With moves like
Toxic
and
Leech Seed
, his
Roselia
can tip the battle in his favor as time goes on. Knock it out with
Fire
,
Ice
,
Flying
, or
Psychic
moves.
Magneton
can be a major threat due to its high
Special Attack
and
Sturdy
Ability, which prevents a one-hit knockout. Strike it with
Ground
moves to take it down. Finally, Wally resorts to using his
Gardevoir
.
Psychic
and
Future Sight
are strong attacks that receive a
same-type attack bonus
, and
Calm Mind
can boost its damage output to dangerous levels. Use
Dark
,
Ghost
, and
Bug
moves to knock it out and win the battle.

Wally admits that he couldn't defeat you this time, but promises to continue his training and catch up to you one day. Continue northward and cross the bridge to reach the exit.
Ever Grande City (north)
With
Victory Road
behind you, only a long, stone walkway separates you from the Pokémon League, where the Elite Four and Champion await your challenge. Follow the walkway to the large building at its end, and prepare for your final test.
