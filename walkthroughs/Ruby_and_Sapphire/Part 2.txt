Deep inside the woods, you come across a researcher from

Rustboro City
. After explaining that he is looking for a
Shroomish
, he is suddenly confronted by a member of
Team Magma
R
/
Team Aqua
S
. The thug had planned to ambush the worker when he left the woods, but grew too impatient for that. Defeat him in battle and he flees the scene, but not before hinting that his friends are up to something in Rustboro. The grateful researcher gives you a
Great Ball
as thanks. He then heals your Pokémon, and rushes off to Rustboro after realizing what his attacker wanted.

(
Cut
), and gives it to you. In the field, Cut may be used to clear away small trees and tall grass.
Devon Corporation
Devon Corporation
is headquartered in a large stone building in the northwest part of town. The company is responsible for manufacturing many of the items Trainers rely on every day, including several variations of Poké Ball and medicine. Only authorized personnel are allowed past the first floor.

stands to the northeast of the Pokémon Center. Talk with the teacher to receive a

Time for a Trade
The Rustboro Gym beckons, but before you step inside, visit the house to the east. Inside is a boy who is looking to trade his
Makuhita
for a
Slakoth
. Makuhita is a strong
Fighting-type
Pokémon that will be a big help inside the Gym. This one is even holding an
X Attack
to sweeten the deal.

Leader: Roxanne
The
Rock
-loving honor student!
The
Rustboro Gym
specializes in
Rock-type
Pokémon. Use
Grass
,
Water
, and
Fighting
moves to deal serious damage, and avoid battling with
Fire
-,
Bug
-, or
Flying-type
Pokémon. As hers is the first Gym in the
Hoenn League
, this graduate of the
Pokémon Trainer's School
has opted for a layout that gives novice Trainers a chance to avoid her subordinates and challenge the Gym Leader directly. Use
Defense
-lowering moves like
Leer
to soften up Roxanne's rock-solid Pokémon, and moves like
Growl
to weaken their
Attack
. As a
Rock
/
Ground
Pokémon, her
Geodude
is especially vulnerable to Grass and Water moves, sustaining 4× the normal amount of damage.

Rusturf Tunnel
Rusturf Tunnel
was a construction project by

that aimed to link
Rustboro City
and western
Hoenn
to the rest of the region. The tunnel was nearly complete when Devon's president,
Mr. Stone
, realized that the work was disturbing the local
Whismur
population. The project was canceled, though only a small bit of debris,
easily cleared
, remained to hinder travel.

The Take-Down
The tunnel is fairly small, so you will find the thief and his hostage shortly after you step inside. Defeat him, and he gives up the
Devon Goods
before fleeing. The old man rushes in to check on his
Peeko
, and introduces himself as
Mr. Briney
before the pair leaves for his cottage near
Petalburg Woods
.
Rustboro City
Devon Corporation
Now that you have reclaimed the
Devon Goods
, head back to the Devon Corporation building in
Rustboro
's northwest corner. The grateful Devon researcher is waiting on the city's east side, and hands you a
Great Ball
before escorting you inside to meet his boss.
On the third floor, the company president introduces himself as
Mr. Stone
. He thanks you for reclaiming the stolen parts, then asks for another favor. He doesn't expect you to work for free, of course, and rewards you with your very own
PokéNav
! In return, he asks that you deliver a
Letter
to a man named
Steven
in
Dewford Town
. To reach Dewford, you will need to cross the sea, so Mr. Stone suggests booking passage with
Mr. Briney
, the friendly old sailor from
Route 104
.
As you leave, take note of the Scientists on the second floor. None of them are having much luck with their projects, except one, who has developed a device that can resurrect ancient Pokémon from
Fossils
.
PokéNav
The
PokéNav
is a small, electronic device produced by Devon Corporation under the orders of Mr. Stone, who wanted a way to keep track of a Pokémon's feelings. It has four different functions:
The Map page displays a map of
Hoenn
, along with the user's current location. It's also possible to zoom in to see a basic layout of towns and cities.
The Condition page shows a Pokémon's five Contest stats in detail. It can be used to search for party Pokémon, or all owned Pokémon at once.
The Trainer's Eyes function records data of up to 69 unique Trainers and will alert the user when any want a rematch. The only requirement is that the user must have obtained five Badges.
The Ribbons page displays all Ribbons the user's Pokémon have acquired. Though hidden initially, this function unlocks when any of the user's Pokémon gains a Ribbon.
