Entrance
Seafloor Cavern, Entrance
When you first enter the cavern, you find
Captain Stern
's sub moored beneath the waves. Rise to the surface and take the north doorway to the next room.
Room 1
Seafloor Cavern, Room 1
This room features two boulders that hinder travel. Go northwest and clear the way with
Rock Smash
, then use
Strength
to move the first boulder southward. Head east and move the second boulder eastward. At this point, there are two paths forward. The northwest doorway leads directly to the southeast part of Room 4. The southeast doorway leads through Rooms 2 and 3 to the southwest part of Room 4.
Room 2
Seafloor Cavern, Room 2
Head south to a fork in the road. The eastern path has a cracked rock that can't be removed from this direction, so head through the doorway to the southwest instead.
Room 3
Seafloor Cavern, Room 3
The doorway to the south merely leads back to the entrance. Instead, go through the northeast doorway.
Room 4
Seafloor Cavern, Room 4
Via Room 1
Move the southeast boulder northward, then do the same to the eastern-most boulder. Push the east-central boulder westward and clear the cracked rock. Move the northeast boulder northward and clear the second cracked rock to the west. Push the northwest boulder westward and walk through the northwest doorway to Room 5.
Via Room 3
Move the southwest boulder northward and the west-central boulder eastward. Push the northwest boulder northward and clear the cracked rock. Move the northeast boulder eastward and walk through the northeast doorway to Room 6.
Room 5
Seafloor Cavern, Room 5
This room has many strong water currents.
Surf
out into the water and ride the currents to a calm spot a short distance to the northeast. Sail east to ride the current to a patch of calm water to the northeast. Go east again to follow the current around the rock outcropping to the west side of the room. Surf westward and take the current to the northwest doorway.
Room 6
Seafloor Cavern, Room 6
This room has many strong water currents. Surf eastward along the south wall to the second current, which leads a short distance northward. Go north from here to reach the west side of the room. Sail north once more to follow the current back and forth on the room's north side. Climb onto shore and go through the northwest doorway.
Room 7
Seafloor Cavern, Room 7
This room has nine boulders that initially block any progress. If entering from the southwest, you'll need to move both southern-most boulders farther apart; if entering from the southeast, you only need to move the southeast boulder eastward. Next, push the middle boulder westward and the north-central boulder northward. After that, move the northeast boulder eastward and head north to run into one of the Admins,

Room 8
Seafloor Cavern, Room 8
There are a dozen boulders here to block progress. Start off by moving the south-central boulder one step northward and the other two southern-most boulders farther apart. Push the first boulder one step westward, then shove the middle boulder one step northward. Move the boulders on the left and right farther apart, then push both the north-northwest and north-northeast boulders to the north wall. Finally, push the middle boulder to either side to reach the doorway.

Even upon defeat, Maxie

still intends to awaken the super-ancient Pokémon. When, he shows the
Blue Orb
R

S
however,
Groudon
R
/
Kyogre
S
unexpectedly awakes. It escapes the cavern with a loud cry and emerges at the water's surface. Maxie
R
/Archie
S
is surprised as he did not do anything. Suddenly, he receives an urgent call from his subordinates outside. The great energy generated by the legendary creature has altered and intensified
Hoenn
's weather as expected, but to dangerous, unforeseen levels. The weather's dramatic shift to harsh sunlight
R
/heavy rain
S
influences any battles on the region's east side. The intense sunlight boosts all
Fire
moves and weakens all
Water
moves. The massive downpours boost all Water moves and weaken all Fire moves. Archie
R
/Maxie
S
and a pair of his Grunts enter a moment later. He condemns the villainous team's actions and tries to reason with its leader, who seems unwilling to believe that his plans are falling apart.
Route 128
The group returns to the surface, where they witness the extreme weather firsthand. The power of the super-ancient Pokémon has surpassed expectations, forcing Maxie
R
/Archie
S
to grudgingly agree to work with his rival to set things right. Once the others leave,
Steven
swoops down to assess the situation. He informs you that the oppressive weather seems to originate in
Sootopolis City
to the northwest. He's headed there to investigate, and suggests you do the same.
