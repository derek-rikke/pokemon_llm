Abandoned Ship
Located on
Route 108
, the
Abandoned Ship
is all that remains from when the S.S. Cactus ran aground. The old vessel has many rusted holes, broken doors, and furniture scattered around. Navigating the structure requires the use of both
Surf
and
Dive
. Once slated for demolition, the half-sunken vessel now exists as a refuge for water-dwelling Pokémon.

Three of the four cabins here are connected. Visit the isolated northwest cabin for a
Harbor Mail
and head downstairs.
B1F
Fight Sailor Duncan and collect a
Dive Ball
from the north-central cabin. Visit the southwest cabin for an
Escape Rope
and climb the stairs in the northwest corner.
1F (west)
Pass through the north cabin to get a
Revive
, then go through the south door to reach the outside of the ship. Climb the stairway there to reach the Captain's office.
Captain's Office
The Scientist inside is investigating the ship on
Captain Stern
's behalf. Stern asked him to find a Scanner, but he hasn't had much success. Pick up the nearby
Storage Key
and return to the basement floor.
B1F
Inspect the locked door to the northeast cabin to insert the Storage Key. The key becomes stuck in the lock, but the door opens. Inside, you find
TM13
(
Ice Beam
). After that, head for the south-central cabin. Seawater has flooded into the room, so use
Dive
to traverse an underwater hallway that leads to an isolated part of the ship.
Hidden Floor
This part of the ship has six cabins. Rooms 1-3 are located on the south side, and Rooms 4-6 are found to the north. Four of these rooms are locked, and although Room 5 is unlocked, there is debris blocking the door.
Enter Room 3 to see a sparkle on the floor; this signifies a hidden item. Pick up the
Rm. 1 Key
from the northeast corner, and the
Water Stone
to the left before leaving.
There are two hidden items in Room 1. The
Rm. 4 Key
is located near the west wall, while the other item is just trash. The visible item is
TM18
(
Rain Dance
).
In Room 4, inspect the trash can in the northeast corner to find the
Rm. 6 Key
.
Enter Room 6 and collect the
Luxury Ball
, then use the narrow hallway to reach the adjoining room. Room 5 has three pieces of trash and one item; the
Rm. 2 Key
is located three steps south of the left-hand trash can.
Visit Room 2 to find the
Scanner
. If you show this to the Scientist in the Captain's office, he asks you to take it to Captain Stern back in
Slateport Harbor
. Once there, Stern offers to trade either a
DeepSeaTooth
or a
DeepSeaScale
for it. The DeepSeaTooth doubles a
Clamperl
's
Special Attack
when held, and triggers Clamperl's evolution into
Huntail
when traded. The DeepSeaScale doubles a Clamperl's
Special Defense
when held, and triggers its evolution into
Gorebyss
when traded.
Route 129
Route 129
Route 129
lies to the south of
Route 128
. Though an optional route, the several Trainers found here make it a worthwhile place to explore.

Mirage Island
While
Route 130
usually appears as a simple stretch of ocean, it is sometimes home to a strange island that seems to appear and disappear. The island is inhabited only by
Wynaut
, which range in level from 5 to 50. A soft soil patch on the island's east side holds a single
Liechi Berry
tree. This is the best Berry to use in
Pokéblocks
, as it will produce Gold Pokéblocks.
Route 131
Route 131
Route 131
lies between
Route 130
to the east and
Pacifidlog Town
to the west. There are no underwater trenches in this stretch of ocean, but several Trainers on the surface are looking to battle. On the route's north side is a large island, currently off-limits, that is home to the towering
Sky Pillar
.

An Old Legend
Visit the northeast house and talk to the girl inside. She tells you a mysterious bit of wisdom passed down from her grandfather:
Six dots open three doors
. Her father also remembers hearing tales of three Pokémon representing the powers of
Rock
,
Ice
, and
Steel
. It seems that Hoenn still has some secrets to discover!
Mirage Man
The old man in the southeast house spends his time by scanning the horizon for
Mirage Island
. Speak with him every day to learn if the island has appeared.
Time for a Trade
The woman in the south-central house is having trouble catching different Pokémon around town. She wishes to trade her
Corsola
for a
Bellossom
. Corsola can be found on
Route 128
, but almost never appear. Bellossom evolves from
Gloom
, which can be found easily in several areas, including the
Safari Zone
.
Friendship is Everything
Stop by the southwest house to meet the brother of the Pokémon Fan Club chairman. Have him evaluate your relationship with your lead Pokémon, and he'll reward your friendship with
TM27
(
Return
). If your Pokémon is unfriendly toward you, he'll give you
TM21
(
Frustration
) instead.
