Pokémon League Lobby
The
Pokémon League
building holds the traditional amenities. The Pokémon Center and PC are located to the left, while the Poké Mart is off to the right. It's a good idea to stock up on
Hyper Potions
,
Full Restores
, and
Full Heals
for the gauntlet ahead.
To increase your chances of victory, you may want to revisit the
Lilycove Department Store
and purchase some
battle items
. These items temporarily raise one of a Pokémon's stats during battle. Using a single
X Defense
or
X Sp. Def
will boost the respective stat by 50%. Using two is equal to a 100% boost, so the Pokémon sustains half the normal amount of damage.
Dire Hits
can be useful as well, as using three or more drastically raises the odds of getting a
critical hit
. In addition, using a
Guard Spec.
protects your Pokémon from stat reduction for five turns.
With your preparations complete, talk to the two Ace Trainers guarding the doorway in the room's center. They verify that you've earned all eight
Hoenn League
Badges before stepping aside, allowing you to enter the depths of the Pokémon League. Challengers must face the
Elite Four
and
Champion
in quick succession, with no outside help. Step through the door to reach the first chamber.
Elite Four
Battle 1: Sidney
Sidney's room
The first member of the Elite Four is
Sidney
, a master
Dark-type
Trainer. His Pokémon are all vulnerable to
Bug
- and
Fighting-type
attacks, and immune to
Psychic
moves.
He leads with his
Mightyena
, which lowers the opponent's Attack with its
Intimidate
Ability.
Crunch
and
Take Down
are strong moves, while
Sand-Attack
lowers the target's accuracy. Use super-effective moves, or a special attacker to bypass Intimidate, to knock it out.
Cacturne
is a
Grass
/
Dark
type, doubly vulnerable to Bug moves.
Leech Seed
lets it slowly sap the target's health to restore its own, and
Cotton Spore
cuts the target's
Speed
. Target one of its many weaknesses to knock it out quickly.
Shiftry
, like Cacturne, has several weaknesses, but may be easier to take down. It can retaliate against Fighting Pokémon with
Extrasensory
, and may use
Swagger
to confuse the target while raising its
Attack
, in the hopes that it will wear itself down. Use a
Persim Berry
to cure confusion, and take it out by exploiting one of its many weaknesses. His
Sharpedo
can be dangerous due to its high Attack and Speed, but its low defenses mean you can make quick work of it.
Surf
and Crunch are its strongest attacks, but it can also score a critical hit with
Slash
. Its
Rough Skin
Ability damages any opponent that makes contact. Last up is his
Absol
; its high Attack means that any of its moves can pack a punch. Slash has an increased critical-hit ratio, while the sure-hit
Aerial Ace
can be used to deter Fighting Pokémon. Its defenses are mediocre, so use your strongest moves to keep up the pressure and take it down.

Battle 2: Phoebe
Phoebe's room
The second member of the Elite Four is
Phoebe
, a master
Ghost-type
Trainer. Her Pokémon are all vulnerable to
Ghost
- and
Dark-type
moves, and immune to
Normal
and
Fighting
moves.
She leads with her first of two
Dusclops
, a defensive Ghost Pokémon that is more interested in status ailments than direct attacks.
Confuse Ray
triggers confusion, which may force the target to attack itself.
Curse
forces it to sacrifice half of its health to lay a curse on the target, which wears away 25% of its maximum health every turn; however, switching your Pokémon out lifts the curse. Use Ghost and Dark attacks to take it down. Phoebe has two
Banette
on her team. The first can burn the target and cut its Attack in half with
Will-O-Wisp
, while
Spite
gradually wears away the opponent's Power Points. The second can wear the target's health away with
Toxic
, while
Skill Swap
switches its
Insomnia
Ability with that of the foe. Both can use
Shadow Ball
, and can cause minor additional damage with
Faint Attack
and
Psychic
, respectively. Due to its unique
Dark
/
Ghost
typing,
Sableye
has no weaknesses under normal conditions; however, using
Foresight
exposes its Dark-type vulnerability to
Fighting
moves. Faint Attack, Psychic, and Shadow Ball deal damage, while
Attract
distracts male targets. Lastly, her second
Dusclops
has access to Shadow Ball,
Ice Beam
, and
Earthquake
; not only do these allow it to deal super-effective damage against a wide variety of Pokémon, the target may end up Frozen. Its final move, Confuse Ray, allows it to further harass its opponent. Take it down with strong Ghost- or Dark-type attacks to win the battle.

Battle 3: Glacia
Glacia's room
The third member of the Elite Four is
Glacia
, a master
Ice-type
Trainer. Her Pokémon are vulnerable to
Rock
-,
Fire
-, and
Fighting-type
attacks.
She leads with her first
Glalie
, which tends to start things off with
Hail
. With Hail in effect,
Blizzard
's accuracy rises to 100% and all non-Ice types take residual damage for five turns. Glalie's
Light Screen
temporarily reduces the damage taken from Special moves, so moves like
Flamethrower
are less effective. Its other moves aren't much of a problem, so this may be a good opportunity for set-up moves like
Swords Dance
. Her second Glalie is much the same; as with the first, take it out at your leisure. Glacia also commands two nearly-identical
Sealeo
. Both carry Hail in addition to damaging
Water
and
Ice
attacks, while the second can distract male opponents with
Attract
. Glacia's biggest threat is
Walrein
, an Ice/Water Pokémon. Its high HP, Defense, and Special Defense means that not even super-effective moves will take it down easily. Decent offensive stats allow it to deal respectable damage with
Surf
, Blizzard, and
Body Slam
.
Sheer Cold
instantly knocks out the target if it hits, but only works on a target of a lower level than the user. Use
Grass
or
Electric
moves to take it down quickly.

Battle 4: Drake
Drake's room
The fourth and final member of the Elite Four is
Drake
, a master
Dragon-type
Trainer. His Pokémon are all vulnerable to Dragon- and
Ice-type
attacks.
Drake leads with his
Shelgon
, a physically-oriented Pokémon.
Dragon Claw
is its strongest move, while
Rock Tomb
helps the slow Pokémon even the playing field by lowering the target's
Speed
. As a Rock move, it also allows it to fight back against Ice Pokémon. Next up is his
Altaria
, a defensively-oriented Pokémon.
Dragon Dance
raises both its
Attack
and Speed by one stage each, which works well alongside
Take Down
. Avoid relying on status ailments for an advantage, as Altaria can rid itself of such problems with
Refresh
. As a
Dragon
/
Flying
Pokémon, it takes massive damage from moves like
Ice Beam
. Drake's team features two
Flygon
; the first uses special moves, while the second relies on physical moves. Both Pokémon are extremely vulnerable to Ice attacks. Drake's final Pokémon is
Salamence
, a Dragon/Flying type. It has high Attack, better-than-average Speed, and respectable defenses. Its
Intimidate
Ability weakens physical attackers, so special attackers, especially those with Ice moves, will have the advantage here.

Defeating the Elite Four has earned you the right to challenge Hoenn's reigning Champion. It is important to note that you will be drawn into battle immediately upon entering the final room, so take a moment to tend to your Pokémon and save your progress before moving on.
Champion
Champion's room
Inside the Champion's hall, you find your mentor
Steven
waiting for you. It seems that you've been sharing adventures with Hoenn's Champion all along! Steven is curious to know how much you've learned in your travels, and asks that you battle him with all your might. He promises to do the same with his Pokémon, as well. The stage is set for a legendary showdown! As Champion, Steven is well aware of the benefits of a diverse Pokémon team. His Pokémon are of many different types, and don't share nearly as many weaknesses as the Elite Four's teams. However, he still prefers his beloved
Steel
types, and most of his Pokémon are either part-
Rock
or part-
Ground
types—no surprise from this well-known stone collector. With such a varied team, you'll need to switch out your Pokémon as needed to capitalize on the weaknesses of Steven's Pokémon.
Steven leads with
Skarmory
, a
Steel
/
Flying
Pokémon with very high Defense; this makes physical attacks very ineffective. Skarmory likes to set up with
Spikes
, which damages any opposing grounded Pokémon switching in. By setting three layers, the opponent loses 25% of their maximum HP on the switch.
Toxic
can be very disruptive as well, as it
badly poisons
the target. Its other moves,
Aerial Ace
and
Steel Wing
, aren't very threatening. Strike with special-based
Fire
and
Electric
attacks to inflict serious damage.
Next up is his
Claydol
, a
Ground
/
Psychic
Pokémon. Claydol plays a defensive role, using
Reflect
and
Light Screen
to lessen the amount of damage sustained from physical and special attacks, respectively. This can make any progress very difficult to achieve while these effects are active.
TM12
(
Taunt
) can prevent these status moves for a few turns, while
TM31
(
Brick Break
) lifts their effects before dealing damage.
Earthquake
and
AncientPower
are strong attacks, but it can't make good use of them due to its mediocre offenses. Target it with
Water
-,
Grass
-, or
Dark-type
moves to keep up the pressure.
His
Aggron
, a
Steel
/
Rock
Pokémon, has an incredibly high Defense, and its
Sturdy
Ability causes
one-hit knockout moves
to always fail. Steven also has three
Full Restores
at his disposal, and will likely use one to heal a weakened Aggron. Its Attack is very high, allowing
Earthquake
to deal serious damage.
Dragon Claw
,
Thunder
, and
SolarBeam
aren't as intimidating as they could be due to its lower
Special Attack
, but can still pose a threat. Aggron is extremely vulnerable to
Fighting
- and
Ground-type
moves.
Next is his
Cradily
, a very defensive
Rock
/
Grass
Pokémon. Though it may not deal serious damage, it can still harass the opponent with
Confuse Ray
and
Giga Drain
, which steals the target's health for itself.
AncientPower
may raise each of its stats by one stage, and
Sludge Bomb
may poison the target. Be quick to counter its status conditions, and strike back with
Bug
,
Fighting
,
Ice
, or
Steel
attacks.
His
Armaldo
is an unusual
Rock
/
Bug
Pokémon. The biggest threat in its arsenal is AncientPower, as it receives a
same-type attack bonus
and may also raises its stats.
Slash
has an increased
critical-hit
ratio, while
Aerial Ace
is guaranteed to land a hit. Use items like
X Defense
or moves like
Reflect
to boost your Defense. Its seldom-seen typing leaves it vulnerable to moves of only a few different types. Use
Water
-, Rock-, and
Steel-type
attacks to exploit its weaknesses and knock it out.
Finally, Steven sends out his heaviest hitter:
Metagross
, a high-level
Steel
/
Psychic
Pokémon.
Meteor Mash
strikes hard, thanks to a same-type attack bonus, and may raise the Pokémon's even higher.
Psychic
is another STAB-boosted move, while
Hyper Beam
deals heavy damage but forces it to recharge for a turn. It may be a good idea to inflict a
Burn
, both for its lingering damage and its Attack penalty. Otherwise, hammer away with your strongest special-based
Fire
,
Ground
,
Ghost
, and
Dark
attacks to claim the knockout and the battle.

With the battle concluded, Steven congratulates you on your impressive victory. Just as he is about to crown you the new Hoenn League Champion, May/Brendan rushes in with some advice for challenging the Champion, only to find that you've already done so.
Professor Birch
arrives not long after, and rates your Pokédex before congratulating you as well.
Hall of Fame
Steven then leads you into the
Hall of Fame
, where all Champions are honored. He asks that you set your Poké Balls in the machine here, so that your name and those of your Pokémon can be recorded for posterity. During the process, a shot of each fighter appears briefly on-screen. The screen fades to black, and the game is saved.
