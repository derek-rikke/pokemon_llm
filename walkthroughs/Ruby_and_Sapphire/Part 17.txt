Route 133
Route 134
The waters of Routes
132
,
133
, and
134
hold strong ocean currents that make travel difficult. While moving primarily westbound, these currents can send you sailing in almost any direction. This makes it necessary to revisit the area in order to explore every island.

Northern path
Ride the central currents to Swimmer Dana, then sail westward to reach a
Rare Candy
opposite Fisherman Ronald on the northwest island. From here, Surf westward through the northern shallows of Route 133 to reach the north side of the route's northwest island. Collect the
Star Piece
here, then sail west to the calm waters on Route 134's north side. Take the current south of here to reach the large, thin island. Fight Black Belt Hitoshi, then Surf west to reach the shallows outside
Slateport City
.
Central path
Ride the southern currents to the southeast island to fight Black Belt Kiyo. Wade into the waters off the north end of the shallows to follow the current to Fisherman Ronald on the northwest island. Sail westward to ride the current to the southern of two shallows on Route 133, and collect the
Big Pearl
there. Continue westward to reach the south side of Route 133's northwest island, and battle Cooltrainer Warren. Sail west again to battle Bird Keeper Alex in the shallows of Route 134's largest island. Head back into the water to follow the current to Slateport City.
To the Depths
Ride the southern currents to fight Black Belt Kiyo on the crescent-shaped island, then sail westward to a calm patch of water surrounded by shallows. Follow the currents westward to be funneled through a bottleneck; this leads to calm waters with two Swimmers, Debra and Linda. Pass through the rocky southern islet to reach a rectangular patch of shallow water situated between Routes 133 and 134. Step into the water from the west-central side to reach a deep, dark pit of water surrounded by a ring of rocks.
Dive
beneath the waves and follow the underwater path southward. The markings on the nearby wall are an ancient form of writing, and translate to
Go up here
.
Surface from this point to emerge in an ancient ruin known as the
Sealed Chamber
.
Sealed Chamber, Entrance
Sealed Chamber, Back Room
Sealed Chamber
The
Sealed Chamber
is a mysterious ruin located in the depths of
Route 134
. The many stone tablets positioned around the chamber feature the same mysterious writing that was found near the underwater entrance. Solving some of
Hoenn
's oldest mysteries hinges on deciphering this age-old system.
Entrance
The first chamber holds ten stone tablets that act as a key to decoding this ancient writing system, known as
Braille
. These 28 characters correspond to the 26 letters of the alphabet, as well as the comma and period. Inspect the markings on the cavern's north wall to reveal a phrase, which translates to
Dig here
. Using
the field move
causes the wall to fall away, granting you access to a second cavern.
Back Room
The central ruins are encircled by
six more stone tablets
which tell of a powerful Pokémon that was sealed away. The message on the north wall reads,
First comes
Relicanth
. Last comes
Wailord
.
Wailord's pre-evolved form,
Wailmer
, can be found in many areas with the
Good Rod
or
Super Rod
, while Relicanth can be found only in a few underwater areas. Position these Pokémon in their respective places in your party and examine the wall again. This causes a mighty earthquake to rock the Sealed Chamber, while the sound of doors opening echoes from somewhere far away. Three separate ruins have now been opened, and each one holds a legendary Pokémon!

Stop and wait. Wait for time to pass twice.
Close the message box and stand still at the north wall for two full minutes. Once enough time passes, a secret passage appears out of nowhere!
