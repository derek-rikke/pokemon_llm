Mossdeep City
Mossdeep City
Mossdeep City
stands perched on an island near
Hoenn
's eastern edge, where the winds are mild and the weather conditions are stable. This makes it the perfect place for launching rockets, and a perfect home for the
Mossdeep Space Center
. The
seventh Gym
in the
Hoenn League
, run by twin Gym Leaders, is located on the north side of the island, and
Steven
's house can be found on the island's northwest corner.

Steven's House
The house on the island's northwest edge belongs to
Steven
, and contains part of his rock collection. He greets you when you step inside, and hands you
HM08
(
Dive
). In certain bodies of water, there are dark spots where the water runs unusually deep; using Dive at one of these spots lets you descend to the ocean floor far below. Swim to a point where the sunlight filters down from above and use Dive again to surface. With this move, you will be able to pursue Maxie
R
/Archie
S
to the
Seafloor Cavern
—but you'll need to beat the Mossdeep Gym first.
Running Errands
Visit the house nearest the stairway to the Space Center to meet a young woman who uses a
Wingull
to send letters to a friend in
Fortree City
. Talk to the Wingull and it will take flight, off to deliver another note. If you return to Fortree and visit the Pokémon Breeder in the northeast house there, he will give you a
Mental Herb
that his Wingull found in its travels.
Score the Super Rod
The house overlooking the Gym belongs to a lone Fisherman. Speak to him to receive the
Super Rod
, a high-end fishing rod that can reel in all kinds of sea life.
Mossdeep Space Center
The
Mossdeep Space Center
stands on a hill in the northeast. A Sailor near the viewing area will give you a
Sun Stone
he found on the beach.
Mossdeep Gym
Mossdeep Gym
Mossdeep City Pokémon Gym
Leaders: Liza & Tate
The mystic combination!
The
Mossdeep Gym
specializes in
Psychic-type
Pokémon, which are vulnerable to
Bug
-,
Dark
-, and
Ghost-type
moves. Dark Pokémon are both immune to Psychic moves and able to inflict super-effective damage. Avoid using
Fighting
- and
Poison-type
Pokémon. The Gym features a series of
spin tiles
and several switches; when flipped, these switches alter the direction of the red tiles, allowing challengers to progress to the twin Gym Leaders.
Go northwest from the entrance and flip the switch; this redirects the red tile to the left. Walk north onto the arrow tiles, which lead west to a battle with Psychic Preston. Go west to slide north and east to the second red tile, which diverts you to a battle with Psychic Maura. Head north to fight Psychic Samantha and flip the nearby switch; this redirects the second red tile. Go back south, then south from Psychic Maura to the entrance. Follow the arrow tiles on the right to the third red tile, and a battle with Psychic Fritz. Flip the switch to redirect the red tile, then go northeast to slide around to a small clearing near Psychic Maura. Head south to slide around to the northwest and flip the final switch near Psychic Virgil to redirect the fourth red tile. Go south to slide back to the entrance, and take the left path once more to reach the Gym Leaders.
Twins
Tate and Liza
send out two Pokémon at once, drawing challengers into a
Double Battle
.
Lunatone
can lull its opponent to sleep with
Hypnosis
, while
Solrock
can scorch
Grass
Pokémon looking to target their
Rock
typing. Both of their Pokémon are weakened by
Water
moves; by using
Surf
, you can attack both at once and bring the battle to a quick end. Otherwise, you may want to target one Pokémon at a time in what would essentially become a two-on-one battle.

Entrance
An old man in the entry chamber offers to make a
Shell Bell
for your Pokémon. But first, he needs you to collect some of the cave's natural resources:
Shoal Shells
and
Shoal Salts
. These items are replenished each day, so there's no limit to the number you can collect. Once you hand over four of each item, he crafts the health-restoring item for you. Surf northwest and take the doorway there to reach the next chamber.
Second Cavern
Surf along the water in a clockwise direction, collecting the four Shoal Shells and a
Rare Candy
on the way. Take the southeast doorway back to the entrance, where you can collect a
Big Pearl
on the nearby ledge.
Low tide
Entrance
An old man in the entry chamber offers to make a
Shell Bell
for your Pokémon. But first, he needs you to collect some of the cave's natural resources:
Shoal Shells
and
Shoal Salts
. These items are replenished each day, so there's no limit to the number you can collect. Once you hand over four of each item, he crafts the health-restoring item for you. Head through the north doorway to reach the next chamber.
Second Cavern
Head up the stairway, go north and climb down the east-central ladder.
Fourth Cavern
Grab the Shoal Salt and

Second Cavern
Go west then south along the two bridges, then climb down the ladder in the center.

Focus Band
from him. Continue east to find another Shoal Salt, then use
Strength
to move the boulder eastward and descend the ladder to the south.
Ice Cavern
The final cavern is permanently encased in ice, and the slick floors hinder travel. Go south from the ladder, across two ice patches. At the third ice patch, slide west to the second snow patch within it. Slide north, then west and south to the third small snow patch. Slide south, east, then north to continue on. Slide north to the snow patch near the narrow stairway. Move west then south to a rock, then east and north to the central plateau and the
NeverMeltIce
on its south end. Slide south from the narrow stairway, then west and north to reach the northwest corner. Go east then south to a snow patch, then north to a rock near the room's northwest corner. Head east, south, and west, then move north, west, south, and west to the small snow patch. Slide north, east, then south to reach
