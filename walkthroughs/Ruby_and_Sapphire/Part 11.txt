A Berry A Day
Slateport City
When you arrive in
Slateport
, head straight for the northeast part of town. Outside Slateport Harbor, you find
Captain Stern
wrapping up a TV interview in front of a small crowd. Afterwards, you catch up with him for a little chat where he informs you of his newest discovery. He's found an underwater cavern on
Route 128
, and believes it to be the den of a super-ancient Pokémon long though to have been extinct. Just then, you hear a voice booming out from a megaphone. It's
Maxie
R
/
Archie
S
, who mocks the captain and thanks him for the
submarine
.
Slateport Harbor
After rushing inside the building, you find
Maxie
R
/
Archie
S
and a Grunt standing near the sub, ready to depart. He accepts that you won't simply leave him to his plans, and wonders if you will visit their hideout in
Lilycove City
. But he's come too far to be stopped now, and he and the Grunt quickly escape in the sub.
Lilycove City
Lilycove City

Pokémon Trainer Fan Club
Members of the
Pokémon Trainer Fan Club
discuss popular Pokémon Trainers and Gym Leaders. After entering the
Hall of Fame
, several members announce themselves as your fans, as well.
Cove Lily Motel
The villainous team's hideout on the edge of town has kept most tourists away, bringing the
Cove Lily Motel
's business to a halt. As a result, there's nothing of interest here at the moment. After resolving the conflict with the villainous team and entering the
Hall of Fame
, the Game Freak staff will visit the motel during their trip to Hoenn. The Game Designer will give Trainers the Poké
Diploma
after completing the
Hoenn Pokédex
.
Pokéblock Master's House
The Pokéblock Master's house stands to the north of the harbor. Talk to her and her family to learn tips on crafting potent
Pokéblocks
.
Rival Battle 4
When you approach the Department Store, you find
May
/
Brendan
waiting outside. She/He offers to battle you to determine which Trainer has been doing a better job of raising their Pokémon.

Once the battle ends, your friend heads back to

Lilycove Department Store
Welcome to the
Lilycove Department Store
! This massive shopping center offers a wide array of merchandise, so Trainers can find almost any item for sale here.
1F: Service Counter, Lottery Corner
The
first floor
is a welcome center. The receptionist on the left greets visitors, while the one on the right runs the
Pokémon Lottery Corner
. Talk to her to draw a random Pokémon Loto Ticket. If the ticket's number matches up with any of your Pokémon's
ID numbers
, you win a prize! You can draw one Loto Ticket per day.

2F: Trainers' Zone
The
second floor
offers items that are useful during battle. The left clerk sells Poké Balls and items to cure status ailments, while the right clerk sells Potions, Repels, and other items.
3F: Battle Collection
The
third floor
sells stat-enhancing items. The left clerk offers
Vitamins
that permanently boost their respective stat, like
Protein
. The right clerk offers
Battle item
that give a temporary boost in battle, like
X Attack
.
4F: TM Corner
The
fourth floor
offers eight different
TMs
for sale. Speak to the left clerk to buy TMs containing offensive moves, and the right clerk for TMs containing defensive moves.
5F: Decoration Floor
The
fifth floor
is dedicated to
Secret Base
fanatics. Here you'll find a wide selection of
Decorations
to deck out your Base, including dolls, mats, posters, and cushions.
Rooftop Plaza
After entering the
Hall of Fame
, the store occasionally holds a
major clearance sale
. A special selection of Secret Base Decorations are offered, with items listed anywhere from
$
200 to
$
10,000. Though this sale rarely occurs, many of the items available for purchase cannot be obtained anywhere else.
Lilycove Museum
The
Lilycove Museum
stands in the northwest part of town. The museum's curator initially blocks the stairs to the second floor because the upper level is empty. He is still searching for modern and vibrant artwork to display there, and asks you to search for such artwork. If you happen to win a Master Rank
Pokémon Contest
with at least 800 points, an artist will approach you saying that he's done a painting that might even look good in a museum, at which point you direct him to the Lilycove Museum. If you collect one painting for each of the five Contest categories, the curator will reward you with a
Glass Ornament
for your
Secret Base
.
Move Deleter's House
The first house to the east of the Department Store is home to the
Move Deleter
, an absent-minded man with the power to make a Pokémon forget any move. This is the only way for a Pokémon to forget an
HM
move. Unlike the
Move Reminder
in
Fallarbor Town
, the Move Deleter's services are free of charge.
A Berry A Day
Speak to the Gentleman to the east of the Move Deleter's house to get one random Berry. This kind old man will give you either a
Cheri
,
Chesto
,
Pecha
,
Rawst
,
Aspear
,
Leppa
,
Oran
,
Persim
,
Lum
, or
Sitrus Berry
every day.
