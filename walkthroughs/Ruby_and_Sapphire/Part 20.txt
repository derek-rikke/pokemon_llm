Littleroot Town
Home
When the credits conclude, you awaken in your room back in
Littleroot Town
. Head downstairs and
Norman
hands you a gift from
Mr. Briney
—the
S.S. Ticket
. With this, you can ride
Captain Stern
's new ferry! Norman suggests taking the ferry from either
Slateport
or
Lilycove
on the way to the
Battle Tower
on a small island in the southeast part of Hoenn. He encourages you to test your ambition at the facility, before heading back to the
Petalburg Gym
.
The Eon Pokémon
If you check the TV, you'll see a special news bulletin; it seems that a certain unnamed Pokémon has been spotted flying around the region. After viewing this report, you will be able to encounter the legendary Pokémon
Latios
R
/
Latias
S
roaming
across Hoenn.
The Pokémon moves to a different area every time you change locations. The easiest way to track it down is to begin in a central area like
Mauville City
. Find a patch of tall grass near a building, like
Route 117
's Day Care, or the route's end, like
Route 110
. Use Repels to avoid other Pokémon and cross the threshold enough times and the Pokémon will eventually appear nearby. To make matters more difficult, it will also attempt to flee on the first turn of battle. The best way to prevent this is to send out a faster Pokémon to use a trapping move, like
Mean Look
or
Wrap
. If afflicted by a status condition, it will retain this ailment when it is next encountered. After meeting it for the first time, the Pokédex tracks its movements.

Battle Tower
beckons!

1F
After you climb aboard, you find
Mr. Briney
and
Peeko
on the north side of the ship. The two are happy to be back out on the seas, and even more so now that Briney has been made the ship's honorary captain!
There are eight cabins on the main floor, with three cabins on each side holding Trainers who are anxious to battle. On the south side, the second cabin from the left is your own, with a bed where you can rest your Pokémon. In the time it takes you to rest for the first time, the ship will reach its destination. On the north side, the farthest cabin to the right holds a Poké Maniac who gives you
TM49
(
Snatch
).
Basement
Head downstairs to visit the ship's spacious storage. There's plenty of room for Pokémon battles to play out, and the two hardworking Sailors here will happily oblige. Be sure to search the trash cans to discover some
Leftovers
, as well.
Battle Tower
Battle Tower
The great
Battle Tower
was built to provide a challenge to all those able to defeat the Pokémon League, with the best and brightest Trainers from across the region competing here to determine who among them is the strongest. Challengers push on through seven battles in a row, with three Pokémon per side, and levels of either 50 or 100 depending on the chosen mode. No two Pokémon used by the same Trainer can be holding the same item.
Restrictions
Nearly all Pokémon are available to participate, however there are
certain restrictions
.
Prizes
Prizes
are earned after each seventh victory. A single, random item is awarded based on the length of the challenger's winning streak.
The first several prizes
are awarded for wins 7-35 and will each be a random Vitamin:
Protein
,
Iron
,
Carbos
,
Zinc
, or
HP Up
.
Subsequent prizes
are awarded for 35 or more consecutive wins, and will each be one of a random in-battle item:
Leftovers

White Herb
,
Quick Claw
,
Mental Herb
,
BrightPowder
,
Choice Band
,
King's Rock
,
Focus Band

Awards

Gold Shield
. Both are decorations for use in your Secret Base. Upon reaching 56 straight wins in Level 50 mode, a
Winning Ribbon
is awarded to all participating Pokémon. Finally, upon reaching 56 straight wins in Level 100 mode, a
Victory Ribbon
is awarded to all participants.

Sky Pillar
is an ancient, towering altar built for the ascension of Hoenn's ageless protector, the legendary dragon
Rayquaza
. The building's advanced age has left several areas of flooring
unstable

Mach Bike
necessary to reach the apex.

A colored background means that the Pokémon can be found in this location in the specified game. A white background with a colored letter means that the Pokémon cannot be found here.
1F-5F
After climbing through the tunnel from the sea, you emerge on the island's upper level. Enter the tower and climb the stairs to 2F. There are several patches of unstable floor here, so use the Mach Bike to speed over them and continue on. Things get tricky on 4F, where you must stop cycling on one of two cracked tiles on the north side of the floor; this causes you to fall back down to a previously-inaccessible part of 3F. Climb to 5F and take the stairs in the northeast to reach the apex.
Apex
Upon reaching the rooftop, you find the legendary creature beyond one final flight of stairs. At level 70,
Rayquaza
is the highest-leveled Pokémon available, and as such, easily warrants the use of a
Master Ball
. Barring that, you will need a similarly high-leveled Pokémon with excellent Defense to counter it. Be sure to save the game, as you've only got one chance to catch it! As a
Dragon
/
Flying
Pokémon, it is especially vulnerable to
Ice
attacks, but Dragon- and
Rock-type
moves are also useful. Begin with these super-effective moves to deal heavy damage, and consider putting it to sleep before it can restore its health with
Rest
. Follow up with
Grass
,
Fire
, and
Water
moves to wear its health away even further. Beware of its most dangerous move,
Outrage
: after rampaging for several turns, Rayquaza becomes confused from fatigue. While it can deal serious damage to its target, it may also cause the dragon to attack itself in its confusion, and could end up knocking itself out!

Having tied up all the loose ends, your final mission is to complete the Pokédex. The discovery of Hoenn-native Pokémon has brought the total number of species to 386, so there is still plenty to keep you busy!
