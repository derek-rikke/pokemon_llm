The waters of

surround a massive crater, inside of which lies
Sootopolis City
. There's no way to reach the city from the surface, so the entrance must be hidden beneath the waves.

Rest Up
The recent shift in weather has frightened all of the city's residents, and they've all taken shelter inside their homes. Their doors are locked tight, so you can't visit with most of the locals right now. The
Sootopolis Gym
, on an island near the crater entrance, is also closed, so instead Surf eastward to reach the Pokémon Center and rest up for the trial ahead.
Catch Up with Steven
Surf westward past the Gym to a grassy shore. Climb the north stairway and visit the Poké Mart to stock up on
Ultra Balls
for the cave ahead. Continue north until you run into
Steven
talking with another man. The man introduces himself as
Wallace
, Sootopolis Gym Leader and protector of the
Cave of Origin
. Seeing your
Red Orb
R
/
Blue Orb
S
, he asks that you follow him. He leads you and Steven to the cave entrance, where the two of them assure you that with the Orb you hold and your Pokémon by your side, it will finally become possible to stand up to the forces of nature!

Entrance
There's not a moment to lose! Sprint down the entry hall to reach the cave's interior. While
Flash
is recommended, the path to the final chamber is straightforward enough that it isn't necessary.
1F
Head in a clockwise direction to reach the ladder in the northeast.
B1F
Follow the tunnel to the ladder on the west side.
B2F
Great quakes continue to rock the cave as you descend to its lower floors, and a thick mist begins to swirl around you. Race to the south side to find the next ladder.
B3F
Hurry northward to find

(
Waterfall
) in the northwest corner, and climb down the ladder in the northeast.
B4F
When you reach the pool's edge in front of the super-ancient Pokémon, the Red Orb

Attack
and

Aftermath
With the super-ancient Pokémon's rampage put to an end, the skies quickly clear and the climate returns to normal. Steven can be found waiting for you in front of the Gym, where he thanks you for all you've done. He also thanks you on behalf of Wallace, who has returned to his Gym. Steven encourages you to challenge the final Gym Leader before flying off on his Pokémon's back.
Sootopolis Gym
Sootopolis Gym, 1F
Sootopolis Gym, B1F
Sootopolis City Pokémon Gym
Leader: Wallace
Artist, and lover of water
The
Sootopolis Gym
Specializes in
Water-type
Pokémon.
Grass
- and
Electric-type
moves are best here, while
Fire
,
Ground
, and
Rock
Pokémon may struggle. The Gym features three platforms where each icy tile must be traversed once in order to defrost the next stairway. Walking over an ice tile once cracks it; passing by a second time shatters it, leaving you to fall to the Gym's snowy underbelly where plenty of Trainers await.
The first puzzle is a 3×3 grid of ice, with two icy rocks as obstacles. Starting on the south-central tile, move →1, ↑1, ←2, ↑1 and →1. This reveals the first stairway.
The second puzzle is a 7×3 grid, with two icy rocks as obstacles. From the south-central tile, move ←3, ↑2, →2, ↓1, →3, ↓1, →1, ↑2, and ←3. This reveals the second stairway.
The final puzzle is an 11×4 grid, with four icy rocks as obstacles. Starting on the south-central tile, move →2, ↑1, →2, ↓1, →1, ↑3, ←2, ↓1, ←1, ↑1, ←1, ↓2, ←2, ↓1, ←1, ↑1, ←1, ↓1, ←1, ↑1, ←1, ↑2, →1, ↓1, →1, ↑1, →1, ↓1, →1, ↑1, and →1. This reveals the stairway to the Gym Leader.
Wallace
leads with his
Luvdisc
; not much of a threat, but it may still confuse its target with
Sweet Kiss
, and further hinder male targets with
Attract
. As a
Water
/
Ground
Pokémon, his
Whiscash
is only vulnerable to Grass moves; its
Rain Dance
temporarily strengthens Water moves, while
Earthquake
can deter
Electric-type
opponents.
Sealeo
's
Ice
/
Water
typing gives it additional weaknesses to
Fighting
and
Rock
moves;
Water Pulse
and
Body Slam
deal damage while
Encore
forces the target to repeat its previous move. His
Seaking
is little threat unless its target is of a lower level than itself, when
Horn Drill
may score a
one-hit knockout
. Finally, his
Milotic
can deal heavy damage with Water Pulse, and use
Ice Beam
to deal with Grass types; use powerful moves to defeat it quickly, before it can regain health with
Recover
.

Defeated, Wallace awards you the
Rain Badge
, which ensures obedience from all Pokémon and enables the use of
Waterfall
in the field. He also gives you
TM03
(
Water Pulse
) as a prize. With all eight Badges, your next destination is the
Pokémon League
in
Ever Grande City
to the southeast. But first, consider exploring Hoenn's remaining areas, including
Route 129
and beyond.
