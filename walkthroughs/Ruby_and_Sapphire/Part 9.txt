Relic Recovery!
The unending sandstorm seems to have uncovered two treasures from the ancient past in the desert's northeast corner. The
Root Fossil
and
Claw Fossil
belong to two species that once lived in the primordial ocean. The researchers at
Devon Corporation
back in
Rustboro
are able to revive any Fossil they receive into a long-lost Pokémon. The Root Fossil becomes the
Rock
/
Grass
Lileep
, while the Claw Fossil turns into the
Rock
/
Bug
Anorith
. Removing either one from their resting place causes the other to sink into the sand, so choose carefully!
Desert Ruins
The unusual arrangement of stones to the south is known as the
Desert Ruins
. It is believed to mark the resting place of a legendary Pokémon. But with the entrance sealed, you won't be able to investigate until later.
Back to Petalburg City
Now that you've claimed your fourth Badge and combed the desert for treasure, your next stop is
Petalburg City
. The city is far to the southwest, but there are multiple ways to get there.
Head northwest around the volcano to
Fallarbor Town
, then south through
Meteor Falls
to return to Rustboro.
Go south from the desert to
Mauville City
, then west to
Verdanturf Town
. Cut through
Rusturf Tunnel
to return to Rustboro.
Once in Rustboro, be sure to stop by
Devon Corporation
on the way to have the researchers there revive your Fossil Pokémon.

Petalburg City Pokémon Gym
Leader: Norman
A man in pursuit of power!
The
Petalburg Gym
, which specializes in
Normal-type
Pokémon, is styled as a traditional dojo with multiple rooms. Each room has a single Trainer who uses special items to gain the upper hand in battle. The sign on each door gives a clue to the strategy of the Trainer in the room behind it. The first two rooms beyond the lobby are labeled "Speed" and "Accuracy". The three rooms farther on are named "Zero Reduction", "Defense", and "Recovery". The final two rooms before the Gym Leader are labeled "Strength" and "One-Hit KO". A minimum of three Gym Trainers must be defeated to reach the Gym Leader.
Fighting
types like
Machop
and
Makuhita
will give you the upper hand here.

In the final room, your father has been waiting for you. Now that you have earned four other Badges, he is now ready to accept your challenge.
Norman
leads with the first of his two
Slaking
. Slaking usually leads with
Yawn
; if you switch out your Pokémon to keep it from falling
asleep
, your next Pokémon will be safe from attack. This is due to Slaking's Ability,
Truant
, which prevents it from attacking every other turn. However, his
Vigoroth
has no such problem. In fact, the Pokémon is so restless that it can't sleep, due to its
Vital Spirit
Ability. All three of Norman's Pokémon know
Facade
, which doubles in power if the user is
Burned
,
Poisoned
, or
Paralyzed
, though the
Attack
penalty incurred by sustaining a Burn still applies. While
Ghost
Pokémon are usually unaffected by Normal-type attacks, and vice-versa, Norman's entire team can use
Faint Attack
to deal serious damage to such Pokémon.

Afterwards, your father awards you the
Balance Badge
, which boosts your Pokémon's
Defense
by 10% and enables the use of
Surf
in the field. He also hands you
TM42
(
Facade
) as a gift. Norman then remembers that
Wally
's parents stopped by a short time ago, looking for you. Visit them in their home next to the Gym, and Wally's father gives you
HM03
(
Surf
) as thanks for helping the young Trainer. In battle,
Surf
is a strong
Water-type
attack; in the field, it allows you to cross bodies of water.
Now that you can use Surf (optional)
You can meet many new trainers and find many new items by crossing the ponds and seas scattered throughout Hoenn. When you're ready to cross the sea, approach the coastline and use
Surf
. Hop on your seafaring Pokémon's back to glide across the water. While Surfing, it is impossible to use the field moves
Cut
,
Strength
, or
Rock Smash
; however,
several
other
moves
are allowed. The Itemfinder can't be used while crossing the waves, but you can use an
Escape Rope
or a fishing rod while doing so.
Also now that you have Surf, Mr. Briney will no longer transport you between his house on Route 104 to Dewford Town, or Route 109, instead you'll have to transport yourself using Surf.

Meet up with Steven
As you leave the beach, you are noticed by
Steven
. He hasn't seen you since your first meeting in
Granite Cave
, and is pleased to see how much you have grown as a Trainer. He wonders if you will raise Pokémon of all types, or only a certain one.
Route 119
Route 119
Known for its sweltering heat and sudden rainfalls, the spacious
Route 119
runs north from
Route 118
to
Fortree City
. The area is filled with patches of tall grass, which hide Trainer and wild Pokémon alike. The extreme weather conditions make this an ideal setting for the
Weather Institute
, located on the north end of this tropical rainforest.

The Mimic Circle
A handful of Trainers in the southernmost patch of long grass like to copy the movements of any Trainer passing by, collectively earning them the "Mimic Circle" nickname. They move when you do, so outmaneuver them to pin them down and start battling. Each one remains in a certain area, which gives you a chance to corner them.
Rest Stop
A small cabin stands beyond the patch of long grass. Speak to the kind woman inside, and she'll let you and your Pokémon take a quick break to restore their health.
Weather Institute
Located on the north end of the route, the
Weather Institute
is a high-tech facility used to study and research the intricacies of weather patterns across
Hoenn
. This research seems to have attracted the attention of
Team Magma

The Next Step
The Admin simply shrugs off her defeat, claiming that the team has other plans before she and the Grunts leave the building. As thanks for your help, one of the researchers even rewards you with a new Pokémon,
Castform
, which changes its type and appearance based on the current weather.
Rival Battle 3
Leave the building and cross the upper bridge.

Once you defeat her/him, your friend rewards you with
