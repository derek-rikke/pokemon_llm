Introduction
After the title screen, the resident researcher of the
Hoenn
region,
Professor Birch
, appears and introduces new Trainers to the Pokémon world. The professor continues, asking the player to select both a gender and a name, which can be up to seven characters long. With that done, Birch sends the player off to begin their journey!
Home
The game begins
in the back of a moving truck
, as your family has just moved here from the far-off
Johto
region. Hop out of the truck to meet
Mom
and step inside your new home. Head upstairs to check out your room and set the clock. Return to the first floor and Mom excitedly calls you over to the TV; the current program just aired a segment about the
Petalburg Gym
, where your dad is the new
Gym Leader
. She then suggests visiting his friend, your new neighbor, Professor Birch. Welcome to Littleroot Town!
Littleroot Town
Littleroot Town
Littleroot
is a quaint little town nestled on the lush southern edge of the
Hoenn
mainland. There are only three buildings here; your home,
Professor Birch
's home, and the professor's Pokémon Laboratory, where he conducts research on Pokémon distribution, in the south.

Having just moved to a new town, why not meet your new neighbors? Visit the house next door to meet the professor's wife, then head upstairs to meet his child,
May
/
Brendan
. She/He suddenly leaves, remembering that Birch asked for help in catching a Pokémon.
Route 101
Route 101
Choose wisely!
Route 101
is a short path that connects
Littleroot Town

Save the Professor!
When you first reach the area, you find
Professor Birch
being chased around by a wild
Poochyena
! His Bag has fallen out of his reach, and he pleads with you for help. Choose one of the three Pokémon from the Poké Balls inside the professor's Bag, and use it to scare off his attacker.

The
Grass-type
Treecko
has the most weaknesses of the trio, with five:
Fire
-,
Bug
-,
Poison
-,
Flying
-, and
Ice-type
attacks. It and its evolutions excel in
Special Attack
and
Speed
. Its Grass moves are strong against
Water
-,
Rock
-, and
Ground-type
Pokémon.
The
Fire-type
Torchic
is great when battling
Grass
-,
Bug
-,
Ice
-, and
Steel-type
Pokémon, but is vulnerable to
Water
-,
Rock
-, and
Ground-type
moves. It and its evolved forms focus on
Attack
and
Special Attack
. As it grows, it gains a secondary
Fighting
type.
The
Water-type
Mudkip
has an advantage when facing
Fire
-,
Rock
-, and
Ground-type
Pokémon, but may struggle against
Grass
and
Electric
attacks. It and its evolutions specialize in
Attack
. As it grows, it gains a secondary Ground type; this protects it from Electric attacks, but leaves it especially vulnerable to Grass moves.
Littleroot Town
Birch's Lab
After scaring off the wild Pokémon, Birch invites you back to the Lab. As thanks for rescuing him, he happily lets you keep the young Pokémon. He then encourages you to visit May/Brendan on
Route 103
for tips on how to be a Pokémon Trainer. When your Pokémon needs a rest, head back home and visit with Mom to have her restore it to full health.
Oldale Town
Oldale Town
Oldale Town
is the first settlement in the region to feature a
Pokémon Center
and a
Poké Mart
. Pokémon Centers are essentially hospitals where creatures can be restored to perfect health. The PC on the counter is always available for Trainers to organize their Pokémon. Poké Marts offer a wide range of items for sale, from Potions to Poké Balls.
Route 102
leads off to the west, while
Route 103
runs northward.

After the battle, follow May/Brendan back to Professor Birch's Lab. Inside, the professor gives you a handy gadget: the Pokédex! This high-tech encyclopedia instantly records information on any Pokémon you see or catch. In addition, his child gives you five
Poké Balls
to start you off on your journey. Now that you have received some Poké Balls, they can be purchased at all Poké Marts in the region. Buying ten Poké Balls at once, at any location, also earns you a bonus Premier Ball.
Meet up with Mom
As you go to leave Littleroot, you see Mom standing outside. She is proud that you have your own Pokémon. In preparation for your adventure, she gives you a pair of
Running Shoes
. By holding down the B Button, these shoes allow you to run twice as fast as the normal walking speed.

Meet up with Dad
When you visit the
Petalburg Gym
, you find your father,
Norman
, standing in the lobby. He is surprised that you've made it this far from home, but is excited for you to become a Pokémon Trainer like him. A sickly boy named
Wally
soon enters, and explains that he will be staying with relatives in nearby
Verdanturf Town
in the hopes that the clean air will do him good. But he is afraid of becoming lonely there, and asks for help in catching a Pokémon to take along. Norman asks that you go with him, and loans him his
Zigzagoon
and a
Poké Ball
. Wally leads you back to
Route 102
, where he successfully catches a
Ralts
.
Back at the Gym, Wally can't thank you enough for helping him catch his very own Pokémon. Your father then gives you some advice: to become a strong Trainer, challenge Gym Leader
Roxanne
in
Rustboro City
before moving on to the other Gym Leaders. Though Norman is also a Gym Leader, he will not accept your challenge until you have earned four
Badges
.
