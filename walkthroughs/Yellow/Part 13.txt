The
Pokémon Mansion
is the decrepit, burned-down former home of a famous Pokémon researcher. The building uses several hidden switches to lock and unlock doors, and Burglars prowl the ruins for valuable items. A series of

a genetically-engineered Pokémon
.

LEADER: BLAINE
The Hot-Headed
Quiz Master!
The
Cinnabar Gym
specializes in
Fire-type
Pokémon.
Water
,
Rock
, and
Ground-type
moves will be the most effective.
Grass
-,
Bug
-, and
Ice-type
Pokémon should avoid battling for now. When playing with fire there is always the chance of getting
Burned
, so be sure to bring some
Burn Heals
. The
Gym Leader
enjoys riddles and has equipped his Gym with machines that display a quiz when examined. When each question is answered correctly, the door to the next room unlocks. This allows challengers to reach the Gym Leader sooner, but gives up the rewards of defeating his Gym Trainers.

Pallet Town
Having now explored nearly all of the
Kanto
region, it is a good time to tie up any loose ends, the most important of which is the
Power Plant
. To get there, fly back to
Cerulean City
and travel east to revisit Routes
9
and
10
.
Route 10
To reach the
Power Plant
, use
Surf
to follow the river southward past the
Rock Tunnel
entrance. It is only a short distance away, with a single PokéManiac outside the building.
