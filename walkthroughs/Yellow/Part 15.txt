All Trainers traveling to
Indigo Plateau
must present their Badges to prove their worth. The first guard looks to see if a Trainer has earned the
Boulder Badge
. The other guards are posted at various checkpoints farther along the route to inspect each Trainer for the other seven Badges. Once the last guard has verified that you have earned the
Earth Badge
, you are free to enter Victory Road.

Near the entrance, there is a boulder to the west and a pressure switch to the east. To activate the switch, use
Strength
to move the boulder eastward (↓1, →4, ↑2, →7, ↑2, →1, and ↓1). Doing so removes the barrier on the rocky ridge. Head to the northeast area to find two items near the north wall. The cave's narrow layout forces you to use the boulder here to block off one item in order to reach the other. Collect either the
Rare Candy
or
TM47
(
Sky Attack
), then exit and re-enter the cave to reset the puzzle and reach the other item. Go west past the two Cooltrainers and climb up the ladder to the northwest.
2F
Another boulder can be found to the south. Push this one southwestward (←1, ↓2, ←2) to reach the switch and clear the next barrier. Walk along the rocky ridge and go down the first stairway. Pick up
TM05
(
Mega Kick
) to the west, then head northeastward to reach a
Full Heal
and
TM17
(
Submission
). Climb the northeast ladder to the third floor.
3F
Go northeast to fight a Cooltrainer♂ and pick up a
Max Revive
. Head to the northwest area to find
TM47
(
Explosion
) and another switch. Climb down the ladder to reach a separate part of the second floor.
2F
Battle the PokéManiac and pick up the
Guard Spec.
on the rock next to him.
Moltres
, the third of the
Legendary birds
, is roosting nearby.
VS Moltres
Moltres
is the third of the
legendary birds
. Use
Water
- and
Electric-type
attacks to weaken it quickly, then follow up with
Grass
and
Fighting
moves to wear its health down further. Like with
Articuno
and
Zapdos
, inflicting status ailments like
Sleep
and
Paralysis
will help increase the chances of capturing it.

When the battle is over, take the ladder back up to the third floor.
3F
Go back to the boulder in the northeast area and push it all the way westward (↑2, ←16, ↓1, ←4, ↓3, →1) to reach the switch. This removes the next barrier so that you can reach the southern area. Walk across the rocky ridge and go south to battle two more Cooltrainers. Head east and push the boulder here down the hole in the floor, then jump down after it.
2F
Shove the boulder all the way westward to the switch. This removes the barrier near where the boulder landed. Climb up onto the ridge and take the ladder up to the third floor.
3F (Southeast)
Climb down the next ladder back to the second floor.
2F (East)
Inspect the rock next to the ladder to find a
Full Restore
. Take the eastern exit to return to
Route 23
.
Route 23 (North)
Follow the tiled pathway to the north and head through the maze of Pokémon statues to finally reach
Indigo Plateau
