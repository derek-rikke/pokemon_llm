A Rare Addition
Visit the house next to the Pokémon Center to find
a girl
who cares for injured and abandoned Pokémon. She has nursed a
Bulbasaur
back to health, but now it needs a caring Trainer to raise it properly. If your
friendship
with
Pikachu
has
grown high enough
, she asks if you would take care of the young Pokémon.
Gym Badges, Explained
The northwest house belongs to a man who offers to explains the effects of the eight
Gym Badges
. Half of them give a slight power boost to a respective stat, while the other half ensure a Pokémon's
obedience
during battle. The first five unlock the use of field moves.

Bike Shop
It would be great to get a
Bicycle
from the
Bike Shop
in the southwest part of town, but they cost a whopping
$
1,000,000! It is not possible to carry that much money, so it looks like you are stuck traveling on foot for now.
Breaking, Entering
The house in the northeast is currently blocked off by a police officer. It seems that
Team Rocket
has broken into the home and stolen
a valuable item
from its residents. Nothing can be done to remedy this at the moment, so set your sights on the Gym instead.
Cerulean Gym
Cerulean Gym
CERULEAN CITY POKéMON GYM
LEADER: MISTY
The Tomboyish Mermaid!
The
Cerulean Gym
specializes in
Water-type
Pokémon. Water-type moves are super effective against
Fire
-,
Ground
-, and
Rock-type
Pokémon, while Water-type Pokémon are weak to
Electric
- and
Grass-type
moves. With
Pikachu
and
Bulbasaur
in tow, beating the Cerulean Gym should be easier than beating the previous one. Other Grass Pokémon—
Oddish
and
Bellsprout
—can be found on the nearby
Route 24
, as well.
Take out
Misty
's
Staryu
quickly to move on to her
Starmie
. Her second Pokémon is both
stronger
and
faster
than Staryu, making its
BubbleBeam
especially painful to vulnerable Pokémon. Use Pikachu's
ThunderShock
, or Grass moves like
Vine Whip
and
Absorb
, to deal serious damage and make quick work of it.

After the battle,
Misty
awards you the

, which ensures obedience from all Pokémon up to level 30 and enables the use of
Cut
in the field. She also gives you
TM11
(
BubbleBeam
) as a prize.
Rival Battle 3
When you head toward
Route 24
,
Blue
appears and taunts you as usual before drawing you into another battle. He leads with his
Spearow
, so start off with
Electric
- and
Rock-type
attacks. His
Sandshrew
, a
Ground-type
Pokémon, takes no damage from
Pikachu
's
Electric
attacks. Luckily, it has no Ground moves to worry about.
Rattata
's
Quick Attack
lets it move first regardless of its
Speed
and
Hyper Fang
can inflict a good bit of damage, so try to take it out quickly. Aside from having grown a few levels, his
Eevee
is much the same as it was in the previous battle.

Nugget Bridge
There are five Trainers to be fought on the famous Nugget Bridge. When all five are defeated, a man at the bridge's north end will reward you with a
Nugget
, a bit of gold that can be sold for a high price. The man then reveals himself as a
Team Rocket
Grunt and tries to persuade you to join the group, and draws you into battle when you refuse.
A Rare Addition
Speak to
the boy
on the northwest hill. He has been thinking that he should release his
Charmander
because he is no good at raising Pokémon. If you promise to care for it, he gives the Pokémon to you, instead.

Sea Cottage
An Unfortunate Turn
The
Sea Cottage
belongs to
Bill
, a famous Pokémon researcher. When you step inside, it seems like Bill must be away, until you speak to the Pokémon inside. His latest experiment has gone awry and combined his DNA with that of a Pokémon! He needs your help, so once he has stepped into the machine, inspect his PC to activate a program to undo the change and return him to normal. As a token of gratitude, he gives you an
S.S. Ticket
, which grants access to the
luxury cruise ship
currently docked in
Vermilion City
to the south.
Bill's Favorite Pokémon
Before leaving the cape, you can exit and re-enter the cottage and inspect Bill's PC to view some of
his favorite Pokémon
. This adds
three
new
pages
to your Pokédex.
Cerulean City
Justice, Served
Once you return to
Cerulean City
, the officer blocking the burgled house has stepped aside, allowing you to enter. Inside are obvious signs of a break-in, like muddy footprints and overturned planters. There is even a large hole in the wall! Step out through the hole to find and confront the thief.

Pokémon Day Care
The house on the hill is the
Pokémon Day Care
. The old man inside will raise one Pokémon at a time while you are away. A Pokémon left here will gain one
experience point
for every step taken. If you bought the
Magikarp
near
Mt. Moon
, this is a good way to raise it. The downside is that he will make every decision, so he may end up deleting a move you would like to keep. He charges
$
100, plus another
$
100 for every new level, to return a Pokémon.
