Head northeast and use
Strength
to move the boulder to the hole in the floor so that it falls to the floor below. Climb up onto the rocky ridge and walk past the first ladder. Push the second boulder down the hole in the northeast area, then backtrack and climb down the first ladder.
B1F
Go northeast over the rocky ridge and push the boulder down the next break in the floor. Backtrack to the west and climb the northwest ladder.
B2F
Walk eastward to find the same boulder and drop it down to the next floor. Once it falls through, return to the first floor and jump down through the hole in the northeast area.
B1F (Northeast)
Drop the boulder through the hole and jump down after it.
B2F (Northeast)
Push the boulder through the next hole and continue after it.
B3F
Moving these two boulders has caused them to fall into the seawater flowing through here, blocking the swift ocean currents and allowing you to
Surf
to new places. Climb onto the rocky ridge to the west and head to the southwest to reach a group of boulders. In the alcove, push the boulder on the right to the north wall. Move the boulder on the left one step southward, then one step westward. Next, push the boulder sitting to the south of the ladder all the way to the west. Move the boulder on the right so it is one step north of the eastern gap in the floor, and drop it down. Push the boulder on the left to the western hole and jump down behind it.
B4F
With the second set of boulders blocking the currents, you may now reach the small northwest island. Be sure to save your progress before approaching the legendary bird Pokémon, as there is only one chance to catch it.
VS Articuno
Articuno
is likely the first of the
Legendary birds
that you will encounter. Use
Fire
-,
Electric
-, and
Rock-type
attacks to weaken it quickly, then follow up with
Grass
or
Bug
moves to chip away at its health. Legendary Pokémon will not let themselves be captured easily, so it will be useful to cause status ailments like
Sleep
or
Paralysis
to increase the odds.

When the battle is over, swim to the rocky ridge and climb up the nearest ladder.
B3F
Walk up onto the rocky ridge and go east. Surf to the eastern shore and climb the ladder in the southeast. This takes you through a series of ladders back up to ground level. Take the exit in the southeast part of 1F to re-emerge on
Route 20
through the western island.
