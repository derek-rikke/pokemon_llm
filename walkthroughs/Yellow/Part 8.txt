As it has been left in its natural state and undeveloped,
Rock Tunnel
is pitch-black inside. Though not required, it is useful to bring a Pokémon that can use
Flash
to illuminate the winding tunnels. There are many Trainers within the cave, whether for the fun of exploring, training, or simply having gotten lost in the darkness.

1F (Northeast)
Defeat the PokéManiac, then climb down the ladder in the northeast corner to reach B1F.
B1F (Southeast)
Go southwest to battle another PokéManiac. Follow the tunnel northeastward, battling a Jr. Trainer♀ and another PokéManiac along the way. In the northeast corner, you will need to battle at least one of the two Hikers before taking the ladder back up to 1F.
1F (West)
Head southeast past the first two Hikers. Turn to the northeast and battle the third Hiker before climbing the nearby ladder.
B1F (Northwest)
Another Jr. Trainer♀, Hiker, and PokéManiac can be found here. Go southwest, then northwest to find the final ladder.
1F (South)
Go south to battle the last three Trainers. The ladder to the exit is located to the southwest.
Route 10 (South)
The southern part of
Route 10
is shorter than the northern one. Several more Trainers can be found here, but if your Pokémon are injured the eastern path can be taken to avoid them.

Lavender Town
A real ghost!
Lavender Town
is a quiet, somber town where people come to visit their departed Pokémon. The area is known for ghost sightings in
Pokémon Tower
. The Volunteer Pokémon House and the
Name Rater
's home are also located here. In addition, the local Poké Mart offers new items like
Revives
and
Great Balls
.

Name Rater
One of the houses on the south side of town belongs to the
Name Rater
. This man judges a Trainer's nickname for their Pokémon, and offers the chance to change it. His service is free, so nicknames may be changed repeatedly.
Lavender Volunteer Pokémon House
The Lavender Volunteer Pokémon House is located in the center of town. Founded by
Mr. Fuji
, the organization was established to care for orphaned and abandoned Pokémon. Many members of the group live here in their safe house while looking after these Pokémon. According to one man, it is odd that Mr. Fuji is not here at the moment, and wonders aloud where he may have gone.
Pokémon Tower
As the place where departed Pokémon are laid to rest,
Pokémon Tower
has a strong connection to the spirit world and most of the wild Pokémon inside belong to the
Ghost
type. The paranormal activity increases beyond the second floor, where ghosts and possessed Channelers are a common sight. However, without a
certain item
, it is impossible to reach the tower's highest floor.
Rival Battle 5
Blue
can be found on the second floor. It is possible to battle him right now, or delay the fight until you are ready to clear the tower.
Restless Spirits
Most
ghosts
inside the tower are truly mischievous Pokémon in disguise that can be battled or captured after obtaining a
certain item
.
Gastly
and
Haunter
are two of only three known
Ghost-type
Pokémon, so it is worthwhile to track them down. The one true ghost here blocks access to the top floor, but as there is nothing that can be done but run from it, it is best to leave it for later. Rumor says there is some kind of prototype in
Celadon City
to the west that can reveal what is hidden.
Route 8

Route 8

Lavender Town
