There is only one place left to explore:
Cerulean Cave
, a mysterious place on the northwest edge of
Cerulean City
. To get there, visitors must
Surf
southward from
Route 24
.

Cerulean Cave, B1F
Cerulean Cave
is a mysterious cavern located in the northwest part of
Cerulean City
. Only the most powerful Trainers who have entered the
Hall of Fame
are allowed to enter due to the powerful wild Pokémon inside. The sprawling cave network is unforgiving, so be sure to prepare well. Pack the
Super Rod
and stock up on
Ultra Balls
, and bring the
Master Ball
as well. It is here that the
genetically-engineered Pokémon
from
Cinnabar Island
's
Pokémon Mansion
fled after escaping the facility.

Use
Surf
to swim westward and grab the

before climbing the ladder to the west.
2F (South)
Go northeastward to find an
Ultra Ball
, then backtrack to the south and head east to get a
Max Revive
. Continue on and climb down the ladder to the northeast.
1F (East)
Surf to the southeast for a
Rare Candy
, then continue westward. Pick up the
Ultra Ball
on the rocky ridge, then take the ladder to the south.
2F (Northeast)
Head northwest to find two diverging tunnels. Take the northern trail first to get a
Full Restore
, then follow the southern trail to the ladder in the far northeast corner.
1F (Northeast)
Go southeast to reach a
Max Revive
, then backtrack and follow the tunnel westward to the next ladder.
2F (Northwest)
Walk to the southwest to grab a
Rare Candy
, then climb down the ladder to the north.
1F (Northwest)
Take the next ladder down to the lower floor.
B1F
Follow the tunnel to a fork in the road. Collect the
Max Elixer
from the eastern path before turning southward. Use
Surf
to reach the rocky ridge in the southwest and collect the
Ultra Ball
and
Max Revive
there. Go east, then north to cross the large rocky ridge and pick up an
Ultra Ball
to the east. Surf southward to find
Mewtwo
, alone on its island. Be sure to save the game before interacting with it, as there is only one chance to catch it.
VS Mewtwo
Not only is
Mewtwo
the strongest Pokémon around, but it has already reached level 70. As a
Psychic-type
Pokémon, it is only vulnerable to
Bug-type
attacks. Bug moves are fairly weak, and so a better way would be to use the
Legendary birds
, as they are the closest to Mewtwo's equals in terms of power. The Legendary Pokémon can restore its health repeatedly with
Recover
, so inflicting status ailments are a must. Not only will this make Mewtwo easier to catch, but
Sleep
,
Freezing
, and
Paralysis
will prevent it from replenishing its HP. It will not let itself be caught easily, so either use the
Master Ball
when the battle begins or be prepared to go through more than a few
Ultra Balls
.

With the

defeated and
Cerulean Cave
cleared, the only thing left to do is to complete the
Pokédex
. There are 151 different Pokémon species that have been discovered so far, leaving plenty of training left to do!
