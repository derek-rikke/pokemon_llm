Route 4 (West)
The Magikarp Salesman
A Pokémon Center stands near the entrance to
Mt. Moon
. Inside,
a shady man
offers to sell you a
Magikarp
for
$
500. The fish is nearly useless until it evolves into the powerful
Gyarados
at level 20. With enough money to spare, you can end up with a strong
Water-type
Pokémon sooner than normal, but you can soon hook a Magikarp for free with the right fishing rod.
