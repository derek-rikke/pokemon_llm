Fishing Guru 1
Visit the house in the northwest part of town to meet a Fisherman known as the
Fishing Guru
. Convince him that you love fishing as much as he does, and he rewards you with an
Old Rod
. This particular model is not the most impressive fishing rod, but it is useful for reeling in
Magikarp
.
Pokémon Fan Club
The building to the north of the
Vermilion Gym
is home to the
Pokémon Fan Club
. Speak to the Chairman and listen to his rambling thoughts to receive a
Bike Voucher
in appreciation. With this ticket, you can return to the Bike Shop in
Cerulean City
at any time and exchange it for a
Bicycle
. Riding a bike allows you to travel twice as fast as walking speed.

Despite his loss, he taunts you again as usual before walking away. Enter the captain's quarters to find him hunched over a trash can; it seems like he got seasick. Speak to him to help him out with a quick backrub and he will be feeling good as new. He gives you
HM01
(
Cut
) to show his appreciation. This field move lets you chop down certain inconveniently-placed trees to reach new areas.
Be sure to collect all of the items on board before leaving, as the ship sets sail when you do. Use
HM01
to teach
Cut
to a compatible Pokémon, then set out for the Vermilion Gym.

POKéMON GYM
LEADER: LT. SURGE
The Lightning American!
The
Vermilion Gym
specializes in
Electric-type
Pokémon. Not only are
Ground-type
Pokémon immune to Electric attacks, but Ground attacks deal serious damage to Electric Pokémon. Keep
Water
- and
Flying-type
Pokémon on the sidelines for now. The Gym Leader can be found in the back room, beyond a set of electronic doors. Reaching him requires challengers to
flip two switches
hidden randomly among the many trash cans. Once the first switch has been found, the second will be in an adjacent can. If the wrong can is inspected and there is no switch inside, the puzzle resets.
Lt. Surge
uses only a single Pokémon, though it has reached a fairly high level.
Raichu
's high
Special
lets it deal a good bit of damage with
Thunderbolt
. Use Ground moves like
Dig
for best results.

After the battle,
Lt. Surge
awards you the
Thunder Badge
, which gives your Pokémon a slight
Defense
boost during battle and enables the use of
Fly
in the field. He also gives you
TM24
(
Thunderbolt
) as a prize.
A Rare Addition
Speak to the police officer near the Poké Mart. She recently apprehended a mischievous
Squirtle
that was causing trouble around the city, and now needs to find a Trainer who can tame its unruly behavior. Seeing that you have three Badges, she recognizes you as a competent Trainer and asks that you give Squirtle a good home.
The next destination is
Route 11
to the east.
