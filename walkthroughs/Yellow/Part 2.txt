Route 1
Route 1
is a peaceful, country road that leads north from
Pallet Town
to
Viridian City
. The path is riddled with patches of
tall grass
and one-way
ledges
that make northward travel difficult. It is not yet possible to catch any of the wild Pokémon here, but it is still good to battle them to earn valuable
Experience Points
.

Speak to the man on the south side of the route, near the signpost. He works at the
Poké Mart
in
Viridian City
and gives you a
Potion
as a free sample.
Viridian City
Viridian City
Viridian City
is a small, nature-loving city that is enveloped in green year-round. It is located between
Route 1
to the south,
Route 2
to the north, and
Route 22
to the west.

Pokémon Center
The first building you will see is the
Pokémon Center
. This Pokémon hospital will heal your team to full health and eliminate any status ailments they may have. Each facility also has a PC for Trainers to use, where they can access their Pokémon storage and item storage. As Trainers may only carry six Pokémon with them at once, any others are immediately transferred to storage upon capture. It is a good idea to heal up and save your progress whenever you find a Pokémon Center.
Poké Mart
Another shop sits to the northeast of the Pokémon Center. This is the local
Poké Mart
; these stores offer a variety of Poké Balls, Potions, and other items. It is a good idea to stock up on supplies whenever possible, as there is no telling what you may run into on your journey.

Special Delivery
When you step inside, the shopkeeper recognizes you as someone from
Pallet Town
and calls you over to the counter. It seems that
Professor Oak
had ordered something that was recently delivered. The shopkeeper hands
Oak's Parcel
to you and asks that you take it to him. The man is adamant, so you will not be able to make any purchases until the delivery is made.
Pokémon Academy
The
Pokémon academy
in the city's center teaches inexperienced Trainers about the basics of battle. A blackboard in the front of the room describes the five
status ailments
that can affect a Pokémon.

Oak's Lab
Deliver
Oak's Parcel
, a custom Poké Ball, to him and
Blue
arrives a moment later. The professor has a request for each of you: take the
Pokédex
he invented and use it to gather information on all the Pokémon in the world. This handheld device is a high-tech encyclopedia that records data on every Pokémon you encounter, and will be complete when you catch a member of every species. It was Oak's dream to do this himself, but his advanced age means that he must rely on the two of you instead.
Blue's house
Visit your rival's house before leaving town and speak to
his sister
to receive a
Town Map
.
Viridian City
With
Oak's Parcel
delivered, it is now possible to purchase items at the Poké Mart, and the
old man
that had blocked the path northward is feeling better now that he has had his coffee. When you pass him, he demonstrates how to catch a Pokémon as an apology for being rude. His attempt is unsuccessful, and he heads off to buy more Poké Balls.
At this point, you may proceed north to Route 2, or make an optional detour westward to
Route 22
first.
Route 22
Running into Blue for the second battle
It is not yet possible to fully explore
Route 22
, but you may still hunt for new Pokémon. A short way into the route,
Blue
appears and challenges you to a battle.

Rival Battle 2
Little has changed since your fight in Oak's Lab, but his Eevee has learned a new move. Blue has added a
Spearow
to his team, as well. Use the same tactics from your last battle to wear his Pokémon down and take the win.

After the battle, be sure to heal your Pokémon and stock up on Poké Balls, then continue on to
Route 2
.
Route 2 (West)
Route 2
Route 2
runs northward from
Viridian City
to
Pewter City
. Much of the route's west side is occupied by a large maze of trees known as
Viridian Forest
.
Overgrown trees
block access to the east side for now. Head through the
gate
to enter the forest, a whole new area with new Pokémon to catch!
