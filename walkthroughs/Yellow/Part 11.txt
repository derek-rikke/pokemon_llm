Fly, Fly Away
Use

on the small tree to reach the secluded northern area. Enter the house beyond the gate and speak to the girl inside. She prefers to spend time on her own and gives you
HM02
(
Fly
) to keep her hideaway a secret. Using Fly in the field allows a Trainer to instantly travel to any city or town that had been visited previously.
Roadblock
A
Snorlax
has fallen asleep near the gate, blocking the path. Use the
Poké Flute
to wake the Pokémon, which attacks in a grumpy rage! Snorlax are hard to find, so catch it if you can.

FUCHSIA CITY POKéMON GYM
LEADER: KOGA
The Poisonous
Ninja Master!
The
Fuchsia Gym
officially specializes in
Poison-type
Pokémon, although there are several
Psychic
- and
Ground-type
Pokémon to be found inside. Poison Pokémon take serious damage from Psychic and Ground moves, while
Grass
and
Bug
Pokémon may struggle against them. The Gym Leader is trained in the skills of the ninja, and has installed a series of nearly invisible glass panels to disorient any challengers. Anyone looking to battle the Gym Leader must first find the path between these panels to reach the middle of the room.
Koga
's team includes
Bug
and Poison Pokémon, so
Fire
-,
Flying
-, and
Rock
attacks will be the most effective. His Pokémon tend to use
Sleep
and
Poisoning
techniques, so be sure to bring along some
Awakenings
and
Antidotes
.

After the battle,
Koga
awards you the
Soul Badge
, which gives your Pokémon a slight
Speed
boost during battle and enables the use of
Surf
in the field. As a prize, he also gives you
TM06
(
Toxic
), which he claims is a secret ninja technique from over 400 years ago.
Safari Zone
For
$
500, Trainers who visit the
Safari Zone
are given 30
Safari Balls
and allowed to catch any Pokémon they can find. There is a catch: visitors are restricted from using their own Pokémon to weaken the wild Pokémon first. Instead, they may throw either bait or rocks before attempting capture. Throwing bait makes a Pokémon less likely to run, but harder to catch; throwing a rock has the opposite effect. When visitors run out of Safari Balls or walk 500 steps, the game is over.

Enter the safari and head to the northeast to reach the second area.
Area 1
Climb onto the larger rocky ridge to the south and pick up the
Carbos
. Head west to reach several patches of tall grass,
TM37
(
Egg Bomb
) on the edge of a lake, and a
Max Potion
to the northwest. Collect the
Full Restore
near the rest house and take the northeast exit.
Area 2
Go northwest through the tall grass and climb onto the rocky ridge. Head northeast from the three ponds to find
TM40
(
Skull Bash
). Turn west near the rest house to pick up a
Protein
and follow the path to the southwest exit.
Area 3
Head south to find a set of
Gold Teeth
, then go west to get
TM32
(
Double Team
) before entering the Secret House. It seems that no one else has ventured this deep into the park, so the
HM03
(
Surf
) is yours. Use it on a
Water
Pokémon, like
Gyarados
or
Lapras
, and you can cross the pond to the south to reach a
Max Potion
and a
Max Revive
on the way back to the entrance. Otherwise, you can backtrack through the other areas until the timer runs out, which likely will not be much longer.
