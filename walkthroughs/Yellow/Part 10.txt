Silph Co.
The
Silph Co
. is the leading manufacturer of items like Poké Balls, Potions, and TMs. Their products are supplied to every Poké Mart in the region. The company has been a target of
Team Rocket
, first for their
Silph Scope
prototype, and now for a top-secret development project. The Rocket Grunt posted outside the building has fallen asleep, leaving a perfect opportunity to sneak inside. The building holds eleven floors, with
warp tiles
allowing the workers to quickly move around. This convenience ends up acting as a maze for anyone trying to reach the top floor.

Afterward, he brags that he will be the world's most powerful Trainer before warping away. Once he leaves, speak to the nearby office worker. Realizing that you are here to save them all, he would like to give you a Pokémon. If you have room in your party, he gives you a
Lapras
. They had been keeping it in their lab, but he thinks it would be much better off with you. Take the final warp tile to the west side of 11F.

As soon as you move off of the warp tile, you are confronted by
Jessie and James
again. They claim that their boss is in a meeting and intend to defeat you so that he will not be disturbed.

With

defeated,

's plans for

have been thwarted. He vows that the group will never fall and promises to return. Giovanni and his underlings make their escape, while their co-conspirators also flee the building. Speak to the president, who is so grateful to you for saving Silph that he rewards you with the
Master Ball
prototype. This improved kind of Poké Ball has a 100% success rate, so be sure to save it for a hard-to-catch Pokémon.
Copycat's house
Now that the Rockets have left the city, the Grunt outside the northwest house is gone. A girl inside known as the
Copycat
likes to collect
Pokémon dolls
. Give her a
Poké Doll
to receive
TM31
(
Mimic
) in return.
Fighting Dojo
Fighting Dojo
Saffron City
is unique as the only city to have two Pokémon Gyms. The
Fighting Dojo
is located in the northeast neighborhood, next door to the
Saffron Gym
. The two clubs had once competed to determine which would become the city's one official Gym, and the
Psychic
Pokémon of Saffron Gym were victorious. There is no Badge to be won here, but defeat the
Karate Master
to earn the choice of two rare
Fighting-type
Pokémon: the hard-kicking
Hitmonlee
or the piston-punching
Hitmonchan
. Use Psychic- and
Flying-type
attacks here for greatest effect.

Saffron Gym
Saffron Gym
SAFFRON CITY POKéMON GYM
LEADER: SABRINA
The Master of
Psychic Pokémon!
The
Saffron Gym
specializes in
Psychic
Pokémon. Only
Bug
attacks deal super effective damage to them, but the few available Bug moves are relatively weak. Psychic Pokémon typically have low
Defense
, so it is better to use moves that deal physical damage, like
Normal
-,
Flying
-, and
Rock-type
attacks.
The Gym uses
a series of warp tiles
to confuse and disorient any challengers. Step on the tile near the entrance to reach the southeast room. To reach the Gym Leader by using as few warps as possible, continue by stepping on the northwest, southwest, and southwest tiles in the following rooms. This leads to the center room, where
Sabrina
awaits anyone up to the challenge.
