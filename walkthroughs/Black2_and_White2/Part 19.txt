Giant Chasm
Victory Road
Fly back to the
Pokémon League
and head down the mountainside to investigate the dream that
Hugh
's sister had. Go down the stairway south of the two Veterans to find a
Zoroark
, the same one from your first visit to the area. It leads you back to the cave it had been guarding, and once inside, runs off down a tall stairway that connects to a ruined building.
N's Castle
N's Castle exterior
B
W
N's Castle
is the former base of
Team Plasma
that suddenly appeared two years ago. It was built in secret in the lands surrounding the
Pokémon League
, but fell into disrepair after the great battle, and eventually collapsed back into the ground.

Upon entering the ruined castle, you find
N
waiting at the bottom of the stairway. He asks that you lead him to the deepest chamber, a place that holds a special meaning to him. Only here will he face you in battle.
North of the entrance is
N
's old room. He tells you the sad tale of his childhood, then leaves the room in silence. Grab the
Luxury Ball
before following him.
A fallen column blocks the walkway, so climb down the rubble to the lower level. Pick up the
Protein
to the west before heading east. Before heading upstairs, be sure to grab
TM50
(
Overheat
) to the southeast.
2F
Go west until you reach the large crack in the floor, where N stops you. He says simply,
"This is our destination... Go inside."
Enter the throne room and head north, where he catches up to you. He tells you about losing to a certain Trainer two years ago, and having to accept new ideas. He wants to know if you are a Trainer whose heart is strong enough to do that. He summons his friend
Zekrom
B2
/
Reshiram
W2
to his side, and asks if you are ready to battle. Despite having only one Pokémon, it can put up a serious fight. Defensively, you may want to use a high-level
Ground-type
Pokémon against Zekrom, or a high-level
Rock-type
Pokémon against Reshiram. Offensively,
Ground
moves like
Earthquake
and
Ice
moves like
Ice Beam
will be a big help.

Opelucid City
While you are here, you can visit with
Drayden
in his home. He can teach the strongest Dragon attack,
Draco Meteor
, to any of your
Dragon-type
Pokémon as long as they share a strong bond with you. Head west through
Route 9
to reach
Tubeline Bridge
.
Tubeline Bridge
Tubeline Bridge
Tubeline Bridge
is a steel bridge that connects
Route 9
to
Route 8
. It is so sturdy that subway trains running beneath it will not cause it to budge an inch. A recent study reveals that it can support up to 4,934 people at once!

So Loud!
The woman on the east end of the bridge is very frustrated about all the loud noises. The noise level will increase every time you talk to her, from 70 decibels, to 80, 100, and finally 120 decibels. Talk to her when you are traveling with a Pokémon that has the
Soundproof
Ability, and she will notice something interesting about her surroundings.
Charge Ahead
Talk to the Battle Girl near the middle of the bridge. She was trying to outrun the trains, but got overheated. She gives you
TM43

Flame Charge
), a low-power move that raises Speed, before running off again.

Pokémon Fan Club
Talk to the chairman and show him a well-trained Pokémon to get an item. Depending on the number of levels it gained since meeting you, he will hand over up to three different items. A Pokémon that has grown 25-49 levels will earn you an
Exp. Share
; 50-98 levels will get you a
Cleanse Tag
; and a Pokémon that's grown 99 levels will earn you a
King's Rock
.
The girl in the Fan Club will offer to check your Pokémon's mood. Choose a Pokémon to show her, and she will tell you how
friendly
it is toward you.
Aha's Pep Quiz
The home of Aha, Wye, and Ditoh is east of the former Gym. The mother, Wye, pulls you into the game the moment you step inside. The father, Aha, will ask you a question, while Wye gives hints to the answer. A correct answer will earn you an
Antidote
, while an incorrect one will get you a
Parlyz Heal
instead. You can take the quiz once per day.
The Shadows Reappear
Head east from the Pokémon Center and cross the bridge. When you reach the end of the path, the
Shadow Triad
suddenly appears. The Triad challenges you to three individual battles; a Single Battle, a Triple Battle, then a Rotation Battle. They also give you a chance to quit between battles. When the battles end, the Triad disappears without a word; however, they will reappear for a rematch once every season.

The first floor is pretty straightforward. Just follow the path to the stairs.
2F
The second floor is littered with broken columns; these act as a bridge if you don't have a Pokémon with
Strength
. There's an
Elixir
under a column to the northeast, and an
Ultra Ball
on a broken column to the west. Don't miss the
Red Shard
hiding in the rubble!
3F
The third floor is covered with one-way ramps. Jump to the south, then take the middle ramp west then north to reach a
Shiny Stone
. Grab the
Protein
in the northeast before taking the southernmost ramp west to the winding staircase.
4F
Another straightforward floor. Climb the several stairways to reach the north side. To the east, a trio of items lie neatly in a row. These are the
Adamant
,
Lustrous
, and
Griseous Orbs
, which boost the powers of
Dialga
,
Palkia
, and
Giratina
. The legendary titans do not appear in
Unova
, but can still be found through
other
means
.
5F
The fifth floor is made up of four large circular paths around the central column. Head to the right to find a
PP Max
on the outer ring, then go left to reach
TM02
(
Dragon Claw
) on the second ring from the center. Walk around the column to get a
Max Revive
, then go left to reach the stairs.
6F
Another simple floor. Follow the path to find a
Comet Shard
, which can be sold to the Ore Collector in Icirrus for a whopping
$
60,000! Continue on to the stairs in the southwest.
7F
Head on up through the narrow path, and the room begins to shake. Suddenly, the
Dark Stone
B2
/
Light Stone
W2
begins to tremble inside your Bag. The stone floats in the air for a moment, slowly absorbing the aura from its surroundings before reawakening as
Zekrom
B2
/
Reshiram
W2
. In a show of force, it sends out a shock wave of crackling electricity
B2
/blazing fire
W2
as it descends to the ground.
First, exploit its weaknesses to quickly drop its health. Both dragons are vulnerable to
Dragon
- and
Ground-type
attacks; in addition, Zekrom fears
Ice
moves and Reshiram fears
Rock
moves. Next, wear it down gradually with
Grass
,
Fire
, or
Electric
moves. If you happen to defeat it, it will reappear once you defeat the Elite Four and Champion again.

After the battle,
N
appears and tells you to go to the
Giant Chasm
. According to his friend,
Kyurem
has returned! Once he leaves, be sure to track down that hidden
Comet Shard
. It is possible to
Fly
out of here, so take off for
Lacunosa Town
again and head east.
Giant Chasm
The Crater Forest has mostly recovered from the
Plasma Frigate
's impact, except for the sandy depression in the center. Enter the cave to the northeast and head to the back chamber to find
Kyurem
waiting for you. Save the game before starting the battle, as it will be much tougher to catch than the previous dragon.
Dragon
,
Fighting
,
Rock
, and
Steel
attacks will reduce its health the fastest, then weaken it further with
Grass
,
Water
, and
Electric
moves.

When the battle is over,
Cheren
and
Bianca
enter the cave. Cheren is impressed at the sight of
Kyurem
, while Bianca suggests showing your
Pokédex
to
Professor Juniper
. They run off, giving you the chance to grab the
DNA Splicers
that Kyurem dropped. When used, these let you fuse Kyurem with either Zekrom or Reshiram to create
Black Kyurem
or
White Kyurem
, respectively. The new Pokémon draws its level and other details from Kyurem. The next time you use the PC, you will receive some new Kyurem-themed wallpapers.
