Catch up with Juniper
When you catch up to
Professor Juniper
on the first floor, she suggests that you try using different items. She hands you a
Lucky Egg
, which earns 50% more experience points for its holder than normal.
The Nurse
With all the wild
Litwick
around, your Pokémon could get
burned
by their
Flame Body
Ability. Talk to Nurse Dixie on the third floor after defeating her in battle, and she will heal your team to full health.
Ring the Bell
Climb up onto the rooftop platform and ring the bell. The pure tone soothes and comforts the departed spirits. Before you leave, check the west side of the roof to find a hidden
Ghost Gem
.
The Eastern House
A second house stands halfway through
Route 7
. The girl in front of the TV will heal your Pokémon to full health, while the old man at the table adds a few entries to your Pokédex. He claims that he has seen
Tornadus
,
Thundurus
, and
Landorus
, but that they looked completely different.
Mom Checks In
When you head east from the house,
Mom
calls on the
Xtransceiver
. During the conversation, she tells you that she used to work in the reception area at several different Pokémon Centers. She ends the call by reminding you to visit one right away if your Pokémon are hurt.
Twist Mountain
As you continue northeast through
Route 7
, you will soon reach the foot of
Twist Mountain
. When you climb the stairway to the entrance, you find
a burly man
blocking the way. He claims that part of the mountain has collapsed, and it's not safe to venture inside right now. Instead, return to
Mistralton City
to challenge the Gym.
Mistralton City
Mistralton Gym
Mistralton City Pokémon Gym
Leader: Skyla
The High-Flying Girl
The
Mistralton Gym
is housed in an aircraft hangar, and specializes in
Flying-type
Pokémon. These birds are typically vulnerable to
Electric
-,
Ice
-, and
Rock-type
attacks. There are three massive turbines in the back of the building, and an occasional gust of wind can knock you back to the entrance. Move when the wind stops, and hide behind one of the walls when it kicks up again.
Skyla
's Pokémon are all vulnerable to
Electric-type
attacks. Her
Swoobat
and
Swanna
are also weak against
Rock-type
moves, while her
Skarmory
fears
Fire-type
attacks.

Defeated,

awards you the

, which ensures that all Pokémon of level 70 or less will obey you. She also gives you

(

) as a prize.
Juniper returns from Celestial Tower
As you emerge victorious from the Gym,
Professor Juniper
returns from
Route 7
. The professor is headed to Mistralton Cargo Service so
Skyla
can fly her somewhere.
The Kids' Treasure
Visit the house north of the Pokémon Center, and talk to the Youngster inside. Then visit the south end of the runway to find
TM40
(
Aerial Ace
), a treasure that the two kids hid for safekeeping.
Mistralton Cargo Service
Professor Juniper
and
Skyla
are waiting when you enter the Cargo Service building. Talk to Skyla, and
Bianca
comes rushing in to catch a ride just as the group is about to board the plane. The professor's destination is
Opelucid City
, but the unstable
Twist Mountain
prevents anyone from reaching the city by foot from that direction. Instead, Skyla flies the group to
Lentimas Town
, a tiny mountain village in the eastern part of the region.
