Poké Balls
. The little girl wants someone to play a game of rock-paper-scissors using the
Grass
,
Fire
, and
Water
types. The dark-haired girl quizzes you about your
first partner Pokémon
's height and weight; answer correctly to get either a
Grass Gem
,
Fire Gem
, or
Water Gem
, depending on your first partner's type.
The Northern Building
Stop by the building next door, and climb to the second floor. Talk to the young man to get a
BalmMushroom

Onix
or
Gyarados
to receive a
Fluffy Tail
. This can be done once per day.
The Lady inside is stuck in a slump. She hopes that a Pokémon with a cry like an instrument could cheer her up. Show her a
Kricketot
and her mood improves somewhat. After that, show her a
Whismur
to finally knock her out of her slump. She thanks you with a
Metronome
.
The Southwest Building
The Youngster at the bottom of the stairway wants to see a Pokémon that is 8" (20 cm) or shorter. Show him a tiny Pokémon like
Joltik
or
Foongus
to receive a
Poké Doll
. This can be done once per day.
The Lass on the first floor would like to trade her
Ambipom
for your
Excadrill
. After doing so, she asks you to battle in order to show how it has grown. After that she asks for another trade, this time, your
Hippowdon
for her
Alakazam
. She then asks for another battle against her old Pokémon.

From Colress upon his defeat

A handful of Plasma Grunts can still be found on the ship.
Colress
apparently allowed them to stay as long as they bring out their Pokémon's potential by treating them well. Enter the back of the ship and take the warp panel to the room where
Kyurem
was imprisoned. Take the warp to the east to reach the Control Room, where you meet Colress again. He has continued with his research after
Team Plasma
's defeat, and wishes to measure your Pokémon's strength in battle. His
Magneton
,
Magnezone
,
Metagross
, and
Klinklang
are all vulnerable to
Fire
- and
Ground-type
attacks,
Rotom
is immune to Ground-type attacks due to
Levitate
, but it can't stand
Grass-type
moves, and
Beheeyem
fears
Ghost
- and
Dark-type
attacks. Aim for their weaknesses to score massive damage!
