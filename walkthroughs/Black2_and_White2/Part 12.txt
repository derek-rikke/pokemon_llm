The Treasure Hunter
When you reach the sandbar near Parasol Lady Laura, take the western path first. The man further down the beach is a treasure hunter, and will give you some of his extra items. Speak to him every day to get one of the five kinds of
Flute
, which can be sold to the billionaire in
Undella Town
for a high price.
Cobalion is waiting
Farther north, the beach gives way to the forested high ground. Climb the stairway and approach the cuttable trees to find
Cobalion
standing in the clearing beyond. Now's your chance to catch it! Start off with
Fire
-,
Fighting
-, or
Ground-type
attacks to wear it down fast, then follow up with
Normal
,
Grass
,
Ice
, or
Steel
moves to weaken it further. Avoid using
Dark-type
attacks, as its
Justified
Ability raises its
Attack
when it is damaged by those moves. If you happen to defeat it, Cobalion will reappear after entering the
Hall of Fame
at level 65. So you may want to consider capturing Cobalion at a later time if you don't plan on adding it to your team right away.

The Old Legend
Enter the town and head south, and
Professor Juniper
and
Bianca
will call out to you. The professor leads you both to a house on the north side of town. She asks the old woman here to tell the legend of the
Giant Chasm
. The old woman claims that the area was formed when a meteorite that contained a Pokémon crashed into the planet. At night, that Pokémon would attack humans and Pokémon alike, and always appeared with a frigid wind that could freeze someone to the bone. Juniper believes that the walls built around the town may have earned it the name Lacunosa, as lacunosus clouds resemble a fence.
After listening to the old woman's tale,
Professor Juniper
tells you about the legendary
dragon
,
Zekrom
B2
/
Reshiram
W2
. She thinks there is a link between it and the monster in the legend, as minerals found in
Dragonspiral Tower
were also found in the
Giant Chasm
.
The Businessman
Visit the northeast house at night or late night. Talk to the businessman inside to get a
Pecha Berry
,
Bluk Berry
,
Lum Berry
, or
Leppa Berry
once per day.
Zinzolin
Head west from the Pokémon Center to meet up with
Hugh

in the city. Suddenly,
Zinzolin
and a Grunt appear, After hearing Team Plasma's plans, your rival snaps and asks for your help in battle. Combine your strength to take out the two criminals.

Stonewall's Winning Streak
Head up over the bridge, and a Gentleman suddenly stops you. He is trying to set a record for most consecutive wins, and only needs one more to reach 1,000. Even though you defeat him, he can't wait to begin again.
The Voice
Enter the room under the west side of the bridge to find a woman practicing her singing. She chases you out, and when that happens, talk to the girl directly above on the bridge. For clearing up the mystery of the voice she heard, she gives you five
Sitrus Berries
as thanks.

Virizion is waiting
When you reach the west side of
Route 11
, the legendary
Virizion
suddenly leaps down from the cliff. It seems that it, like
Cobalion
, was also waiting for you. Start off with
Fire
-,
Ice
-, or
Flying-type
attacks to wear it down fast, then follow up with
Water
-,
Rock
-, or
Ground-type
moves to weaken it further. Avoid using
Dark-type
attacks, as its
Justified
Ability raises its
Attack
when it is damaged by those moves. If you happen to defeat it, Virizion will reappear after entering the
Hall of Fame
at level 65. So you may want to consider capturing Virizion at a later time if you don't plan on adding it to your team right away.
