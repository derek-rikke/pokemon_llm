runs east to west alongside gentle rivers and thundering waterfalls. The spray kicked up from these waterfalls bathes the area in a thick mist, which can make it tough to see. Above the waterfalls and far to the west lies the
Abundant Shrine
, the only remaining sign that there was once a village here.

near Lass Lurleen.
TM92
(
Trick Room
) lies to the east of Youngster Jaye.
The shrine to
Landorus
stands on a hill to the north. If you visit with a Landorus that was caught
elsewhere
, an old man will appear. He gives a brief history lesson about the
Forces of Nature
before handing over a
Reveal Glass
. This mirror is said to show the truth, and can be used to switch any of the three Pokémon between their
Incarnate and Therian Formes
.
Cross the pond to the east of the shrine to get a
Heal Ball
, then head to the northeastern plot of soil. A
Rare Candy
lies on the west end of the fence, while a hidden
PP Max
lies on the east end.

, respectively.
Black City
Black City
is a modern metropolis filled with skyscrapers. On the north side of the city stands the
Black Tower
.
Market
The Market is located on the south side of the city, but is initially empty. The stores will open one by one as you progress through Black Tower. Only one item may be purchased per day from each store.

Black Tower
Black Tower
The
Black Tower
is a battle arena that was just recently constructed. The Trainers found inside change every time you enter it. Battle these Trainers on your way through the various Areas. Defeat the Boss Trainer at the end of each Area to advance. There are ten Areas in all, each more challenging than the last.
Basic Rules
Unlike other battle facilities, you will earn prize money and Experience Points by defeating the Trainers here. However, using the Bag is not allowed, so you will be unable to use items besides held items to restore health or cure status conditions. Each Area's Doctor will, upon defeat, offer a one-time-only courtesy; if you do not need it at that time, you can return to heal up later. The opposing Pokémon you encounter will not be registered in the Pokédex. It is possible to save your progress during the challenge, and you can quit midway by leaving via the elevator.
Clearing an Area
Defeat Trainers in the Area to receive hints about where to find the Gate Trainer, who controls the door to the Boss Trainer's room. Defeat the Gate Trainer to open the door to the Boss Trainer's room. Defeat the Boss Trainer to clear the Area. A full list of Trainers can be found
here
.
Alder
's grandson
Benga
waits in Area 10's final room; defeat him here then meet him back in
Floccesy Town
to receive a
shiny
Gible
. If you are accessing Black Tower from White 2, a trainer named Janna will serve as the Boss Trainer for Area 10 instead.
After clearing each Area, you will be returned to the entrance to receive your reward. The item obtained is random, and those obtained for clearing Areas 4, 5, 8, and 9 will be doubled. Once Area 5 is cleared you will receive the Tower Key that will allow you to use the
Key System
to swap it into White 2, allowing Black City to be accessed in White 2.

. Work your way to the west side of the cliff to find a trailer parked here; the woman inside is offering to trade her
Rotom
for a
Ditto
, which can be caught in the
Giant Chasm
's Crater Forest. Take Rotom to
Shopping Mall Nine
's warehouse to change its forms. Check out the Transfer Lab before reaching
Marvelous Bridge
.
The Poké Transfer Lab
Poké Transfer Lab
The
Poké Transfer Lab
is the building that houses the
Poké Transfer
itself, the machinery that can transfer Pokémon from a
Generation IV
game. When you first enter, a Scientist leads you to Professor Andrew Park, who is very excited to see that you have all eight badges. After his rambling speech, you can participate at any time. The minigame itself involves two DS systems, a Poké Ball-flinging crossbow, and a few clouds of pink sleeping gas. Pokémon that are transferred from Sinnoh or Johto cannot be returned. They also are not allowed to have any items, or know any HM moves.
Marvelous Bridge
Marvelous Bridge
Marvelous Bridge
is a beautiful futuristic bridge that stretches over the ocean between
Route 15
and
Route 16
. Like
Driftveil Drawbridge
, flying Pokémon sometimes drop their
feathers
on the bridge.
Cresselia
When you pass under the eastern archway, the
Lunar Wing
begins to shine. Hold it up high, and
Cresselia
swoops down. Start the battle with
Bug
-,
Ghost
-, or
Dark-type
moves to reduce its health quickly, then follow up with
Fighting
or
Psychic
moves.

The Magikarp Salesman
On the bridge's west end is
a man
who will sell you a
Magikarp
for
$
500. After enough training, it grows into the formidable
Gyarados
. The fish is foreign to
Unova
, so you won't find it normally; however, you will soon be able to hunt them for free. If you decide to take him up on his offer, return here with an empty slot in your party.
