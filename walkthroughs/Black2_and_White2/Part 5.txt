Battle the Pokémon Breeder
There is a Pokémon Breeder named Irene just north of the gate. She believes that having many battles is the best way to raise a Pokémon quickly, and is happy to battle whenever you visit the area. If you wish to avoid this battle later on, you can do so by walking in front of her from as far to the west as possible.
To the west, a
Mystic Water
lies near the waterfront.
Challenge Colress
Further north,
Colress
is waiting to battle. He uses a special device to wake up and disperse the several
Crustle
that block the road, and the battle begins.

Afterwards, he thanks you with a

The Speed-Focused Girl
Enter the southernmost blue-roofed building on the right, and talk to the female Ace Trainer inside. She asks to see a Pokémon with a certain
Speed
value. If your Pokémon's Speed matches her number, she rewards you with five
Health Wings
; if its Speed is higher, then she gives you only one.
Time for a Trade
In the next building to the north, a Lass would like to trade. If you have a
Cottonee
, she will trade you her
Petilil
. Cottonee can be found in
Castelia
's Empty Lot.
There is also a
Wide Lens
sitting next to the TV on the second floor.
The Maid of Mimicry
In the northeast building, a Maid imitates the
cry
of one of your party members. If you correctly identify the Pokémon, she rewards you with a
Poké Toy
. Only the first correct answer earns the item, but you can visit multiple times to try her challenge.
Rest House
Go west along the newly paved road to reach a vending machine and a rest house. The woman inside heals your Pokémon, so be sure to visit if they get injured.
Planned Expansion Area
South of the rest house is a large area that has been designated for future expansion, and where many items lie hidden. On the ledge between the first two stairways lies a hidden
Red Shard
. A
Hyper Potion
hides in the deep sand south of Policeman Neagle.
TM28
(
Dig
) is sitting in a straight stretch of sand to the northeast, and a
Stardust
sits near Roughneck Silvester and Biker Stanley to the west. To the south, Youngster Sinclair is running laps around a
Grip Claw
. In the deep sand to the east lie two hidden items, another
Stardust
and a
Yellow Shard
. A
Green Shard
lies hidden to the southwest of the Youngster.
On Thursdays, a special
Mandibuzz
appears in the clearing northeast of Hooligans Rob & Sal. This vulture has its Hidden Ability,
Weak Armor
, which lowers
Defense
but raises
Speed
when hit by a physical attack. It reappears every week, so you will have many chances to catch it.

appears to the clearing to the east, near PokéFan Sachiko. This eagle has its Hidden Ability,
Defiant
, which raises its
Attack
when its opponent's move or Ability lowers its stats. It reappears every week, so you will have many chances to catch it.

to good use.

After exploring the ruins, head east from the desert and turn north to reach
Join Avenue
.
Join Avenue
Join Avenue, on the first visit
Join Avenue
is a shopping center that was built north of
Route 4
. The place is still new and has not yet acquired any vendors, but will likely be a popular attraction soon. Come back here daily to expand it into a valuable resource for training and evolving your Pokémon later on.
Become a Manager
Inside, you meet the Avenue's owner and his assistants. He is too busy with other Avenues to manage this one, and asks that you take his place as manager. After accepting his request, he asks about your favorite phrase, and what you say when you are moved. Each answer can be up to eight characters long, and will be communicated to others through Tag Mode, so choose words that make people happy. The owner thanks you and leaves, but his assistants Jacci and Future stay behind to help out. They can always be found at the office if you need to change your title or favorite phrase.
Development
The avenue develops as you communicate with more people. First, you need to invite visitors to be residents of the avenue, so they set up shop here. Recommending these shops to visitors raises not only the shops' popularity, but that of the avenue as well. More popular shops will have a wider selection of products.
Communication
There are several ways to attract visitors. Not only passersby using Tag Mode will visit, but people you interact with through the
C-Gear
, meet in the
Union Room
, or trade with over the
GTS
will also appear. Even if you do not communicate with others, a few visitors will pass through the avenue every day, so you can still develop the area.
Building a Shop
Speak to a visitor to hear what kind of dream they have. After being invited to be a resident, he or she will build one of eight kinds of shop. Nurseries cannot be built until you enter the
Hall of Fame
and the avenue rank is 15 or more.
If I were to make my dream come true on this avenue...

Rise in Popularity
As you recommend shops to visitors, the popularity of the shops and the avenue rises, and the shops' rank goes up. Recommend shops that visitors will like; if others are recommended, the visitors will leave. As a shop's rank rises, it will have more products available. A shop's rank goes up to 10. As the avenue's rank rises, you will earn various rewards. The avenue's rank goes up to 100.
