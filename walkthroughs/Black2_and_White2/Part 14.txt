Head south over a series of ledges to fight Pokémon Rangers Mikiko and Johan, and pick up the
Dive Ball
between them. Defeat Black Belt Rocky to clear the south exit to
Undella Bay
, then cross the bridge to return to the north side. Grab the
Full Restore
near Battle Girl Tia, and jump the northernmost ledge again. Turn east this time, and go down the stairway to reach the water's edge. Nab the
Heart Scale
from the bit of dry land, then
swim
northward. Take the stairway to the lower level.

Go south to the smaller of the two raised platforms. Pick up the
Max Repel
to the south, then drop the boulder into the hole. Continue east to reach Battle Girl Maki and the larger raised platform. Use
Strength
to move the first five boulders into position, and pick up the
Rare Candy
on the way past. Move the sixth boulder and head northwest to return to the first floor.
1F
Head west to find
TM06
(
Toxic
) sitting atop the cliff, then jump the lower ledge near the water. Climb the opposite stairway to find an unusual boulder blocking the east exit. Activate the
Colress MCHN
to wake the rock, which turns out to be a
Crustle
. The delicate instrument breaks after the battle. Step outside to reach a secluded part of
Route 21

The Plasma Frigate
Outside, the
Plasma Frigate
is anchored at the water's edge. As you approach it,
Hugh
emerges from
Seaside Cave
and wonders aloud how to board the ship. Just then, the gangplank falls with a heavy thud, and
Marlon
disembarks the ship. He still hasn't changed his mind about
Team Plasma
, but wanted to help the two of you. He leaves, and Hugh runs up onto the ship.
Plasma Frigate
Two Plasma Grunts block the way; defeat one and the pair runs off. Follow Hugh north in search of
Zinzolin
.

at level 50, which is great against the four
Poison-type
Pokémon unless it happens to be a

There are three Grunts here; the first will not attack, but the others will if they detect you. If you need to heal up, you can visit the bed in the northeast room. In the west room, a Grunt will record the entries for
Reshiram
and
Zekrom
in your
Pokédex
. The six rooms that surround the stairwell each have warp panels that aim to disorient intruders. Four of these tiles lead back to the switches inside the North Entrance.

Plasma Card
, which can be obtained from the female Plasma Grunt in the center of the dining hall, the west/southwest room.

Go south from the entrance to encounter a pair of Plasma Grunts.
Hugh
shows up and attempts to battle them, but a former Plasma member, acting as a spy for
Rood
, uses his wits to chase them off. Continue south to reach a boulder; use
Strength
to clear the way, then
Surf
north to get
TM13
(
Ice Beam
). Head southwest to reach the
Route 13
entrance.
Duck outside to pick up a
Yellow Shard
and two hidden items, a
Moon Stone
and a
Max Potion
. The path to the south leads back to
Route 13
, so push the boulder into place to open the shortcut. To the east, a
Hyper Potion
lies in plain sight on the beach, while a
Heart Scale
lies hidden on a nearby rock.
Re-enter the cave and turn west. Inspect the nearest rock for a hidden
Star Piece
, then move the boulder in the southwest corner to reach a
Max Repel
. A pair of Plasma Grunts blocks the west exit to
Route 23
for now. In the northwest corner, a hidden
Ultra Ball
lies on the west side, while a second
Star Piece
lies behind a boulder on the north side. Turn east and move the last boulder to find a hidden
Ice Gem
. Jump the ledge and head southwest to reach the Crater Forest.
Crater Forest
Inside the crater,
Rood
and a pair of Grunts from the old
Team Plasma
are trying to convince a group of current members that what they are doing is wrong.
Hugh
breaks up the fight, drawing the Grunts' attention, and drawing the two of you into battle. Rood gives you three
Max Revives
as thanks for your help. His group will keep the others busy while you and Hugh track down the
Shadow Triad
aboard the
Plasma Frigate
. Check the surroundings for a
Razor Claw
and a
Moon Stone
, then follow Hugh up onto the mound of ice and into the ship.
Plasma Frigate
Hugh
is already holding off a group of Plasma Grunts, leaving you free to advance. The front of the ship has already been cleared, so head to the stern this time.

When you warp into the room where
Kyurem
is imprisoned, you draw the attention of the nearby Plasma Grunt. He turns out to be the spy that is working for
Rood
, and informs you of the room's layout and how to proceed. To the south is a maze of pipes; navigating the area requires activating switches that extend and retract these pipes.
There are five clues needed to learn the password, which changes with every adventure and may contain letters or numbers. Using the password requires the
Plasma Card

Deactivate the barrier and proceed.
Kyurem
is stuck in a cage to the north. When you approach it,
Zinzolin
appears and tries one last time to stop you. His Pokémon have only grown by one level since your last encounter, so the strategy to defeating him is the same.

at the request of an old friend, in order to research how to bring out the full power of Pokémon. It does not matter to him which method does the job. One last battle with you will apparently show him which is right. Four of his Pokémon are vulnerable to
Fire

attacks, while his
Beheeyem
fears
Ghost

Defeated,
Colress
recognizes your strengths. Which method is better,
Team Plasma
's science or the bond between Trainers and Pokémon? He suggests that you find out for yourself by taking the warp panel on the west side of
Kyurem
's prison.
Ghetsis' Quarters
Meet
Ghetsis
, the man who has been behind
Team Plasma
's schemes from the beginning. He is furious that
Colress
lost to you, but his ambitious plans are still in motion. He intends to use
Kyurem
to freeze
Unova
and force people and Pokémon to submit to his reign. Before exiting the ship, he summons the
Shadow Triad
to take care of you. The Shadows only attack when challenged, so you will have a chance to heal your Pokémon between battles.

Defeated, the
Shadow Triad
finally returns the Pokémon that belonged to
Hugh
's sister.
Purrloin
has evolved into
Liepard
and only listens to the Triad, but Hugh finally got what he wanted. Leave the ship, descend the mountain of ice, and enter the cave to the north.
Inner Cave
Proceed to the deepest part of the cave to find
Ghetsis
. He proclaims that he will freeze the region from here, where
Kyurem
's power is strongest. He summons the dragon and commands it to attack you with
Glaciate
, but something interferes. It's
N
, flying in on
Zekrom
B2
or
Reshiram
W2
. His dragon told him that Kyurem is suffering, and he is here to help. But Ghetsis planned on that, and uses the
DNA Splicers
to fuse Kyurem with the other dragon, resulting in
Black Kyurem
B2
or
White Kyurem
W2
. Disrupting signals from Ghetsis' cane prevents capture, so there is no choice but to defeat the new dragon, which is vulnerable to
Dragon
-,
Fighting
-,
Rock
-, and
Steel-type
attacks.

The defeated dragon separates back into two, and Kyurem vanishes. Enraged about having his plans suddenly thwarted, Ghetsis aims to take you out himself. His Pokémon have few weaknesses, so switch out as needed to use the most damaging moves possible. Take out
Cofagrigus
with
Ghost
- or
Dark-type
moves, and
Seismitoad
with
Grass-type
attacks.
Drapion
fears only
Ground-type
attacks, while
Toxicroak
is vulnerable to
Flying
and
Psychic
moves. Use
Ice
- or
Fighting-type
attacks to take care of
Hydreigon
, which is a greater threat than normal thanks to its
Life Orb
.

Utterly defeated,
Ghetsis
appears to have lost his senses, and the
Shadow Triad
takes the old man away. Without a leader,
Team Plasma
is left in ruin.
N
suggests visiting the
Pokémon League
before climbing onto his dragon and flying off.
Hugh
enters to make sure that Team Plasma is truly finished, and after a few words of encouragement, informs you that
Route 23
can be reached from the west side of the outer cave.
