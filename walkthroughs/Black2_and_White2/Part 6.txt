Battle Subway
,
Pokémon Musical
, and even an amusement park. Two sports arenas,
Big Stadium and Small Court

Afterwards, the Subway Bosses return to the Subway and your partner thanks you with a

. This item lets you record a video of a battle in the Subway, or a Link Battle with a friend.
Gear Station
Map of the various railway lines
From
Gear Station
, you can board any one of the eight railway lines. The seven others lead to their respective challenges, but the Brown Line is different. Rather than have you battle another group of Trainers, this line is the only way to reach
Anville Town
far to the northwest.
The Battle Subway
In the
Battle Subway
, you earn
Battle Points
for every seven Trainers you defeat. These points can be redeemed at the Exchange Service Corner for
rare items
.
Format
Each train uses its own battle format. The Single Train uses Single Battles, while the Double Train uses Double Battles. The Multi Train pairs you up with another Trainer, with each using two Pokémon. The Super Single, Super Double, and Super Multi Trains become available after reaching 21 consecutive wins on each of the three other lines. Lastly, the Wi-Fi Train allows you to battle Trainers from around the world.
Rewards
There are seven Battle
Medals
to be earned here, and three of them can only be obtained by defeating the Subway Bosses. Also, one of three trophies will be displayed at home in
Aspertia
after reaching 49 straight wins on any of the Super Trains.
Big Stadium and Small Court
Big Stadium and Small Court
are the major sports venues of the
Unova
region. The stadium hosts baseball, soccer, and football games, while the court hosts tennis and basketball games. The players double as Trainers and can be battled daily, unless a game is in progress. The number of Trainers and the levels of their Pokémon increase as you earn more Badges. Keep yourself fighting fit by visiting every day.

Musical Theater
The Musical Theater on the north side of the city is where the
Pokémon Musical
is held. When you step inside, the owner gives you a
Prop Case
so you can participate. A girl near the PC gives you
TM49
(
Echoed Voice
) as well.
Amusement Park
The amusement park is located on the east side of the city. South of the entrance is the
Dropped Item
, a lost
Xtransceiver
. The owner soon calls, and the two of you gradually become friends. Male players will meet
Yancy
, while female players will meet
Curtis
. Eventually, you will be able to trade Pokémon.
Shining Roller Coaster
Two years ago, the Nimbasa Gym was located in this building. There are still Ladies and Rich Boys looking to battle here. Proceed by pressing switches to change the coaster's path. Talk to the woman at the back of the building to get a
Parlyz Heal
to help out at the new Gym.

Leader: Elesa
The Shining Beauty
Elesa
has moved the
Electric-type

Nimbasa Gym
to a new building east of the Ferris wheel. The supermodel has designed her Gym with a large runway through the center. A new section is lit up as you approach each Gym Trainer, until you reach Elesa singing on the stage. Her Pokémon frequently use
Volt Switch
to shuffle in and out of battle.
Flaaffy
and
Zebstrika
are vulnerable to
Ground-type
attacks, while
Emolga
fears
Rock-type
moves. Pokémon from the desert, like
Sandile
or
Sandshrew
, are immune to electrical attacks and should have little trouble here.

. Luckily it has been found by a Depot Agent, who is waiting outside the Musical Theater. Talk to him about the girl, then tell her where Pansage turned up. As thanks for finding it, she gives you a
BrightPowder
. She also remarks that
a green-haired man
told her that Pansage wants to be a railroad conductor.
Funfest Mission
When you trade an item with the Backpacker, a new

a bit about each one.

.
