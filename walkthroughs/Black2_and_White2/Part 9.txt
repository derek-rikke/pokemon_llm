Meet up with Cheren
Cheren
is continuing with his investigation outside the Season Research Lab. The data he has collected shows sudden drops in temperature near
Lacunosa Town
,
Castelia City
, and
Driftveil City
, with some areas dropping as low as -58°F. He gives you
HM03
(
Surf
) to help you travel around and assist the investigation.
Season Research Lab
The Scientists at the Season Research Lab are conducting research on
Deerling
, and the reason it changes forms with the
season
. If you have an open party slot, one of the Scientists will ask you to raise a rare Deerling that they found, one with its hidden
Serene Grace
ability.
When you have a traveling partner that has a move or ability that can change the
weather
, the Parasol Lady will describe the respective condition in detail.
A Legendary Pokémon Appears
When you reach the westernmost bridge, the legendary
Cobalion
jumps down from the nearby cliff and lands directly in front of you. However, it runs off as quickly as it appeared. Immediately after,
Rood
of the
Seven Sages
appears and claims that Cobalion will be a great asset if you can befriend it.
East of the bridge is a second building. Speak to the woman inside to have her heal your Pokémon. Surf east along the river from here to reach Mistralton Cave.
Mistralton Cave
Two years ago,
Mistralton Cave
was home to
Cobalion
, one of the
Swords of Justice
. But ever since Cobalion left, the cave has mostly been forgotten by people nearby.

The darkness makes it difficult to see, so use

the boulder onto the hole in the floor. Follow the tunnel past Hiker Shelby and move the second boulder into place. The southeast corner connects to

north of the entrance. Move the third boulder into place to create a shortcut, then go south to reach the stairs to 2F.

TM80
(
Rock Slide
) in the northeast corner. Turn around, climb onto the southeast rock platform, grab the

, and continue north. Go down the stairway, turn south, and move the next boulder into position. To the west is an old man who has been searching for
Cobalion
for decades. Long ago, Cobalion,
Terrakion
, and
Virizion
rescued Pokémon from a fire caused by a war between humans. From that point on, the three have refused to associate with people. The old man wonders aloud if Cobalion's hatred has lessened...
When you're done in Mistralton Cave, continue north on Route 6 to reach Chargestone Cave.
