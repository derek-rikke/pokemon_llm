Juniper Tells a Story
When the group gets off of the plane,
Professor Juniper
explains why she brought you along. Two years ago, the legendary dragons
Reshiram
and
Zekrom
each recognized a different Trainer as the hero, and followed its chosen Trainer. Juniper believes that there is no way
Team Plasma
can use them in their plans. She wants you to visit
Opelucid City
and ask
Drayden
, the mayor, about the legendary dragons. To reach Opelucid, you need to first travel east through
Reversal Mountain
, where
Bianca
is headed to do some research on
Heatran
.
Move Tutor
A Move Tutor lives in the western house. He is obsessed with
Blue Shards
, and will teach a variety of moves for the right number of Shards. The next Gym's weaknesses include
Ice
- and
Dragon-type
attacks, so you may want to have him teach
Icy Wind
and
Dragon Pulse
now.
