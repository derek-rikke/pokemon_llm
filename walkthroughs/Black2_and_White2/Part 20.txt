Skyarrow Bridge
Skyarrow Bridge
The
Skyarrow Bridge

Unova
, connecting
Castelia City
to
Pinwheel Forest
. Pedestrians travel across the elevated walkway, while trucks rumble by on the lower level. As you leave the city, the Castelia skyline appears in the background.

The Salesman, The Runner
Midway across the bridge, a man is trying to sell bottles of
Fresh Water
for
$
300 apiece. He claims that he will be in trouble if he can't sell them — his reasons suspiciously change with each meeting — but if you accept, he thanks you for your generosity. If not, you'll need to decline his offer twice; he's a persistent salesman!
Farther along, you will encounter a thirsty man running across the bridge. Give him a
Fresh Water
to slake his thrist, and he dashes off. Repeat the process at the
Driftveil Drawbridge
,
Tubeline Bridge
,
Village Bridge
,
Marvelous Bridge
, and the
Marine Tube
in that order, and he will return to the
Skyarrow Bridge
. Meet up with him here again to receive a dozen bottles of
Moomoo Milk
in gratitude.
Pinwheel Forest
Pinwheel Forest
Pinwheel Forest
is a lush forest where the trees have grown so densely that little sunlight gets in. The road leads to the southeast, where the brighter edge of the forest connects to
Nacrene City
.

BalmMushroom
near Youngster Henley and Lass Helia. Head north through the log to meet
Gorm
of the
Seven Sages

Bug Gem
. Head southeast to find
TM22
(
SolarBeam

Rare Candy
. Surf across the pond to reach a
PP Max

Nest Balls
.
Exterior
Fight School Kid Millie and follow the fence eastward to get a
Full Heal
. Head south to meet a Battle Girl, then east to find a
Protein
on the railroad tracks. Keep going south to find a few big puddles. To the west is Ace Trainer Kelsey; to his north is a
Nugget
, and to his southeast is an
HP Up
. Check the largest puddle to find a hidden
Max Elixir
and go east. Climb the stairway to get a
PP Max
near Battle Girl Lee, then go north to reach the challenge rock. Have a Fighting Pokémon chip away at it to receive a
Stardust
once per day. Go down the northern stairway to find a hidden
