When you and
Hugh
leave the ship, he asks that you register each other in the
Xtransceiver
. If you call him up, he will give you advice about where to go next on your journey. Pop Roxie will be waiting here, so you can return to
Virbank City
anytime.
Oceanfront Road
Harlequin Hunt
When you step onto Oceanfront Road, you are stopped by a
Harlequin
, who is advertising the Castelia Harlequin Hunt. To complete the hunt, you need to speak to three other Harlequins scattered across the city; one is waiting in the
Medal
Office, another is in Passerby Analytics HQ, and the third is hiding out in the Battle Company building. This Harlequin gives you a
Bicycle
to help you travel around the city faster. After you meet the three others, you can talk to this clown again to receive a
Rare Candy
.
Bridge Gate
The gate on the city's east side leads to
Skyarrow Bridge
. Talk to the dark-haired woman inside to get a
Quick Claw
. A Worker blocks the way to the bridge; his team is busy inspecting the bridge, so it may be a while until it is open to the public again.
The Royal Unova
At the Cruise Ship Dock, the
Royal Unova
can be boarded in the evening for a fare of
$
1,000. Defeating a certain number of Trainers earns you a prize, but both of these change depending on the day. The ship returns to port after a certain amount of time has passed.

1F
The
Battle Company
stands to the left of the Harlequin. Inside, a Janitor near the entrance gives you an
Exp. Share
, which lets a Pokémon earn experience even if it does not battle. To the right, a female Ace Trainer asks which Pokémon that you took on your journey, and gives you a special item for it; a
Miracle Seed
for
Snivy
, a
Charcoal
for
Tepig
, or a
Mystic Water
for
Oshawott
. The first of the three Hunted Harlequins is seated at the other table.
47F
Battle the Clerk♂ near the elevator to get a couple of
Quick Balls
, then fight the Clerk♂ in the center of the room to receive 5
Timer Balls
. There is a
Guard Spec.
near the female Clerk, and the Scientist gives you a
Scope Lens
.
55F
Grab the
Ether
to the left, then go right to meet the Janitor from the entrance. The elderly man used to be the Battle Company's President, a title that now rests with his grandson. When you defeat him, he claims that his dream as president is to release a device that lets people talk to Pokémon.
Location of Unity Tower in Unova
Unity Pier
Unity Pier is across from Narrow Street, in the center-west part of the city. The blue ship here ferries people to
Unity Tower
, which is only accessible after completing an international trade. If you talk to the girl she will give you one
Destiny Knot
.
Liberty Pier
The ship at the westernmost pier travels to
Liberty Garden
. Unlike
Black and White
, the
Liberty Pass
is not required to reach the island.
Location of Liberty Garden in Unova
Liberty Garden
Liberty Garden
is an island that was bought 200 years ago by a wealthy person who wished for a world where humans and Pokémon could live freely. The lighthouse in the center of the island has a small room with evidence that
a small Pokémon
once lived here alone.
Passerby Analytics HQ
When you enter the
Passerby Analytics HQ
across from Liberty Pier and talk to the lead researcher, he will appoint you to a job as a statistician. This title lets you receive Passerby Survey requests, and interact with other players. Complete the questionnaires to receive a variety of items. He will reward you with a
Soda Pop
when you complete all the surveys.
Castelia Street
Castelia Street building
In the building on the left side of the street, a female Guitarist on the eleventh floor will give you
TM44
(
Rest
).
Game Freak
22F
Across the street, you can visit with
Game Freak
, the people who made
Black 2 and White 2
. You can battle Morimoto and Nishino each once per day. There is also a
Revive
lying nearby. If you meet with the Game Director at the desk in the corner after completing the
Pokédex
, he will reward you with a certificate that will be posted on the wall of your bedroom.

Casteliacones
Casteliacone
This ice cream shop offers its famous soft-serve treat to customers only once per day. These tasty treats eliminate any status problems a Pokémon might have. They can be bought individually or by the dozen for
$
100 apiece, except in winter.
Studio Castelia
Across from Casteliacone is Studio Castelia, which displays many paintings from local artists. The man near the sculptures wants to see a different type of Pokémon every day. If you show him a Pokémon of the correct type, he will reward you with either a
Cheri
,
Chesto
,
Pecha
,
Rawst
, or
Aspear Berry
.
Narrow Street
When you pass by the dumpsters outside Café Sonata, you are stopped by a man looking for his sunglasses, who gives you
TM70
(
Flash
).
Café Sonata
In the center-left part of the city is Café Sonata. Many people stop to relax here after a long day of work. A
Meloetta
can learn
Relic Song
from the Musician, and the manager gives you a
Moomoo Milk
on your first visit.
Gym Street
Western building
On the first floor are three people; the
Name Rater
, the girl at the table is a
Pokémon groomer
, and woman is the
Feeling Checker
. The
Medal
Office is located on the second floor; here you can check your Medal rank and number of Medals. Visit after collecting 50 Medals for your first rank-up ceremony.
Fennel
's Lab is on the third floor; she and her assistant explain the
Game Sync
, while
Amanita
explains the PC Boxes and
Pal Pad
.
Burgh is away
Clyde
is blocking the entrance to
Castelia Gym
, and claims that
Burgh
is not here. Just then a girl named
Iris
, who used to be the
Opelucid
Gym Leader, shows up. The two of you talk about
Team Plasma
, and she says that she may know a place where suspicious people would go to hide. Follow her east along Oceanfront Road to Thumb Pier, where you can enter the
Castelia Sewers
.
Hugh
arrives suddenly and enters the tunnels without a blink, so follow him inside.
Castelia Sewers
Inside the Sewers
The water level inside the
Castelia Sewers
changes depending on the season. As the waters rise in spring and summer, and recede in autumn and winter, new areas become accessible while others are closed off. Traveling through the Sewers is the only way to reach Back Street and the Empty Lot.

Inside the Sewers, your rival suggests that the two of you team up. He will help you battle wild Pokémon, but not against other Trainers. He heals your Pokémon after every battle, so take advantage of this to train your team. With him around, wild Pokémon will appear in pairs, so knock one out before trying to catch the other.
Head west and climb the north stairway. At the end of the walkway is a
TwistedSpoon
and a pair of
Team Plasma Grunts
. Once you and your rival beat them in a Double Battle, they run off claiming that they got the Pokémon they needed.
Hugh
is anxious to look for more Plasma members, but the Gym Leader,
Burgh
, arrives and claims that he did not see any other suspicious people. Hugh gives you
HM04
(
Strength
) as thanks for your help, then leaves. Just then,
a mysterious man in a white coat
exits the cave, and it seems that he was watching your battle. He praises the way you battled and leaves. Burgh leaves as well, leaving you free to explore the sewers.
Not far to the south is a stairway leading up to the Empty Lot. This tiny park has a ring of tall and dark grass, a
Miracle Seed
, and a man who claims that this is where it all started for Castelia.

A colored background means that the Pokémon can be found in this location in the specified game. A white background with a colored letter means that the Pokémon cannot be found here.
Go south from the stairway, and check the island west of Janitor Felix for an
X Sp. Def
. Continue west to the next island to reach Doctor Heath and some
Leftovers
. In the nearby room, a female Scientist is trying to turn poison into medicine, and will give either a
Potion
,
Super Potion
, or
Revive
once per day, depending on her experiment's results. Now head east to the exit; you've got another Gym to challenge!
Castelia Gym
Castelia City Pokémon Gym
Leader: Burgh
Premier Insect Artist
The
Castelia Gym
specializes in
Bug-type
Pokémon, and the building's theme is based on cocoons. Some of the cocoons are connected by strands of silk, and when you approach them, they pull you in and transport you to another one. Some of them have more than one entrance, and the direction they take you depends on which way you are facing. Battle Harlequin Gary and enter the east cocoon from the right side, then fight Harlequin Anders and enter the next cocoon from the left side to reach
Burgh
.
Burgh's
Swadloon
and
Leavanny
have a double weakness to
Fire
- and
Flying-type
attacks, his Shelmet and Karrablast are weak to Fire-, Flying- and
Rock-type
moves while his
Dwebble
is vulnerable to
Water
- and Rock-type moves. If you can't exploit these weaknesses, an alternative tactic is to use
TM70
(
Flash
) to lower his Pokémon's accuracy.
