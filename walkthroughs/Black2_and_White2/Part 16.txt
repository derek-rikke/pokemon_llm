Aspertia City
Home Again
After defeating the Pokémon League, you'll find yourself back where your adventure began:
Aspertia City
. As you leave your bedroom, Mom says that she is expecting a visitor. A moment later, a man stops by and introduces himself as Professor Juniper!
Cedric Juniper
, father to the other
Professor Juniper
. He then upgrades your Pokédex, enabling
National Dex
mode. This switches the numbering system from the Unova Dex listing to the international listing, though you are free to switch it back. Cedric leaves, and Mom gives you two
Max Revives
as a gift.
Step outside to meet
Hugh
and his little sister, who thank you for helping return her former
Purrloin
. They also tell you of a dream she has been having, of a
Zoroark
calling out to you from
Victory Road
. As they leave, Hugh congratulates you on becoming the new
Champion
.
Mass Outbreaks
Mass outbreaks
of Pokémon will now appear in certain parts of the region. These locations change daily, and are broadcast on the electric bulletin boards in every gate.
Floccesy Town
New Wallpapers
Visit the Pokémon Center and access Amanita's PC to receive a new wallpaper commemorating your entrance into the Hall of Fame. It can be accessed under
Special
on the menu.
Alder's Challenge
Return to
Alder
's house in the northwest part of town to battle the former Champion. His Pokémon are a little tougher than those of
the current Champion
, but thankfully not by much, so he's a good opponent to fight right away as a warmup for some of the upcoming fights.

Half of his team is
Bug-type
Pokémon.
Fire
attacks will roast his
Accelgor
and
Escavalier
, and his
Bouffalant
takes double the damage from
Fighting
moves.
Flying
- and
Psychic-type
attacks work well against his
Conkeldurr
, while his
Braviary
is vulnerable to
Electric
- and
Ice-type
moves. The star of the show,
Volcarona
, takes massive damage from
Rock-type
attacks, though Flying- and
Water-type
moves are also effective. Don't hesitate to use healing items, as his attacks provide a lot of type coverage.
After the battle, his grandson
Benga
runs in. He excitedly tells his grandfather that he made it through the
Black Tower
B2
/
White Treehollow
W2
. He leaves, and Alder suggests that you challenge him in
Black City

Route 20
Inside the Cave of Being
Cave of Being
The
Cave of Being
is a small cave that can be reached by climbing the waterfall on the south side of
Route 20
. It is said that the deepest part of the cave connects to the distant
Sinnoh
region.
Professor Juniper
is inside investigating the area. Suddenly, a mysterious presence can be felt, and the three
lake guardians
—
Uxie
,
Mesprit
, and
Azelf
— appear. They float here for a moment before wandering off. To find them, you must step on a certain spot when they are nearby so that they reveal themselves.
Mesprit can be found on the
Celestial Tower
's rooftop. Stand at the foot of the bell platform to detect its presence.
Azelf can be found on
Route 23
. Travel to the forest on the west side, and stand on the platform near the
Strength
puzzle to detect its presence.
Uxie can be found in
Nacrene City
in the southeast area of Unova. Stand outside the Nacrene Museum to detect its presence.
