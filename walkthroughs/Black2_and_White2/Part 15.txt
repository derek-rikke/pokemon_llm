East side
North of the cave exit is a house with a female Ace Trainer inside. Talk to her to have your Pokémon restored to full health. This is especially useful immediately after the events that occurred in the
Giant Chasm
.
Southwest of the rest house is a small tree near the river.
Cut
it down or
Surf
around it to reach the
Heart Scale
Head north through the river valley to a large stairway. Wade across the river to a second house; the old man inside will give out
TM35
(
Flamethrower
). Climb the stairway, pick up the hidden
Rare Candy
to the east, then detour across the bridge to the south. Grab
TM05
(
Roar
) across the next bridge, then head south from Black Belt Luke. Check the rock for a hidden
Star Piece
, then pick up the
Iron
to the south and cross the next bridge. A second Star Piece is sitting on the ledge here, and there is a
Hidden Grotto
off to the south. Once you have collected all the items, return to the top of the large stairway and head west.
West side
A short way down the path is Pokémon Ranger Lena, who gives you a
Sitrus Berry
when you defeat her. Head west, chop down the tree, and continue on to reach a raised platform to the southwest. Pick up the
Full Heal
and move the boulder south into the hole. Backtrack a bit and head west to reach Hiker Doug; cut down the nearby tree and move the second boulder southward. Return to the east side of the forest, and chop down the tree here. Head northeast to find an
Ultra Ball
hidden in the trees, then go west to reach a
Repeat Ball
. Wander westward through the forest to have Black Belt Benjamin challenge you, which clears the path he was blocking. Cross the platform in the northwest to get an
HP Up
, then loop around to take the path where Benjamin was standing. Chop down another tree and head south to find a
Calcium
, then jump either ledge to the east.
Strength puzzle
Go east and move the third boulder one space to the left.
Surf
across the water and move the fourth boulder into the hole for easier access. Jump the ledge and push the boulder all the way to the north for later. The fifth boulder sits to the northeast; push it one space to the right so it lines up with the hole to the south. Now go south then west to find a
Yellow Shard
hidden in a rock. Surf west, then go back east and push the third boulder two spaces right, then one space up to the hole. This gives you an opening to move the final three boulders into place. Shove the second boulder east, the fifth boulder south, and the sixth boulder east.
Climb the stairway and go east to get a
Max Potion
. Continue east, then go north over the bridge. Inspect the grass patch to reveal a hidden
PP Up
, then grab
TM12
(
Taunt
) to the west. Climb back down the stairway and go north. Ignore the first "item", and grab the second one, a
Green Shard
. Jump the ledge and head north towards
Victory Road
.

Entrance
N
is waiting at the area's entrance, and gives you
HM05
(
Waterfall
) to help navigate the rough terrain. Once he leaves, follow the path to be scanned for each of the eight Badges, and the Badge Check Gate lowers into the ground. A Pokémon Center stands to the northeast, and some old ruins lie to the east. Go east from the Center to find
TM01
(
Hone Claws
), then enter the ruins to get a
PP Up
to the south and a
Star Piece
to the north. Bring a party with
Cut
,
Surf
,

, and step inside the first cave.
Although Victory Road is nearly identical in both versions, the route to the mountaintop and Trainer locations will vary.

to the east, then hike north through the tall grass to reach the water. Sail under the bridge and climb the stairway to get an
Ultra Ball
. To the north is a
Max Repel
and a few Trainers; take them out and step inside the next cave.
Cave 2F
Check the dead-end straight ahead for a hidden

To the east is Ace Trainer Chandra, and there is an
Ultra Ball
lying in the dark grass further east. Go southwest and chop down the tree to reach a

As thanks for helping him return his sister's Pokémon, he gives you
TM24
(
Thunderbolt
). Once he leaves, exit the tunnel and pass under the gate to reach the
Pokémon League
!
Pokémon League
Outside the central plaza
The
Pokémon League
is the greatest trial for any Trainer. By defeating the
Elite Four
, you will earn the chance to battle the region's new
Champion
. Stop by the Pokémon Center in the structure to the west. When preparing a team, it is recommended to bring Pokémon with levels in the 60s, if not higher. Consider using TMs to create a more diverse movepool. The Poké Mart offers a wide assortment of items, so be sure to stock up on medicine.
The 17
Medals
earned by using one party Pokémon and Pokémon of a specific type can be earned during this initial challenge. As the entire Elite Four and the Champion use significantly stronger Pokémon in all rematches, using a single Pokémon in the mid-70s can make obtaining the Lonely Champ Medal much easier than trying to earn it later on.
Unlike most of their foreign counterparts, the Elite Four of
Unova
can be battled in any order. The elite Trainers are waiting in their separate rooms, each accessible from the central plaza. From left to right, they are
Shauntal
,
Grimsley
,
Caitlin
, and
Marshal
. After defeating each Trainer, you will be warped back to the plaza, where a blue light shines from the floor. Once all four tiles are lit up, you can challenge the Champion.
Left room: Shauntal
Will-o-wisps line the stairway, and others disappear from
Shauntal
's library when you approach. Her ghosts are all vulnerable to
Ghost
- and
Dark-type
attacks, while
Golurk
and
Chandelure
also take heavy damage from
Water
moves.
Cofagrigus
tends to lead off with
Will-O-Wisp
, and may be difficult to take out thanks to its strong defenses.
Drifblim
's high HP helps to balance out its low defenses, and its
Acrobatics
move hits hardest due to its lack of held item. The biggest threat from
Golurk
is
Earthquake
, but Dark Pokémon should also look out for its
Brick Break
move. Lastly,
Chandelure
's
Fire Blast
and
Shadow Ball
attacks pack quite a punch because of its
Special Attack
, rated fifth-highest among all Pokémon.

Center-left room: Grimsley
Giant metal claws open to allow access to the elevated battlefield, then snap shut behind you. All of
Grimsley
's Pokémon have a weakness to
Fighting-type
attacks.
Liepard
tends to start things off with
Fake Out
, and can distract your male Pokémon with
Attract
.
Scrafty
compensates for its low
Speed
with high defenses, and can mix things up with
Poison Jab
and
Rock Tomb
.
Krookodile
's
Intimidate
Ability lowers its foe's Attack, but moves like

Center-right room: Caitlin
The falling stardust reveals the stairway to
Caitlin
, who emerges from a large white flower. Her Pokémon belong to the
Psychic
type, and take heavy damage from
Ghost
-,
Dark
-, and
Bug-type
attacks.
Musharna
's
Charge Beam
can boost its Special Attack, making
Dream Eater
even more potent.
Sigilyph
is the fastest yet frailest of the group, and can harass its opponent with
Psychic
,
Air Slash
, and oddly enough,
Ice Beam
.
Reuniclus
can use
Focus Blast
to thwart its Dark opponents, and can linger on with
Recover
. Lastly,
Gothitelle
loves to boost its stats with
Calm Mind
before launching an attack, so take it out quickly with a physical move like
Crunch
.

Right room: Marshal
The cage bursts open, the stairway extends, and the floodlights snap on.
Marshal
's team consists of pure-
Fighting-type
Pokémon, which are only vulnerable to
Psychic
- and
Flying-type
attacks.
Throh
can score a critical hit with
Storm Throw
, and lash out with
Rock Tomb
and
Payback
.
Sawk
is faster and stronger, and its
Sturdy
Ability prevents a one-hit knockout.
Mienshao
can inflict massive damage with
Hi Jump Kick
, unless it backfires. Finally, his
Conkeldurr
can boost its already-high stats with
Bulk Up
, and
Stone Edge
is dangerous for any Flying Pokémon.

The Champion's Temple
After defeating each member of the Elite Four, visit the statue in the center of the plaza. Check the plaque, and the statue descends to the large chamber below. Go north and climb up the three flights of stairs to reach the Champion's temple.
Iris
used to be a
Dragon-type
specialist, but her current team is more well-rounded.
Ice
attacks will have the most success against her, but
Dragon
-,
Fighting
-, and
Electric-type
moves will also help. First up is
Hydreigon
; its
Dragon Pulse
is already a big threat, but even more so after a Special Attack boost with
Charge Beam
. Her
Aggron
's sky-high Defense lets it brush off most physical attacks, but it takes massive damage from Fighting moves like
Aura Sphere
, or Ground type moves such as
Earthquake
.
Lapras
'
Ice Beam
can wreak havoc on your own dragons; use Electric or Fighting moves to take it out. Her
Druddigon
's attacks hit hard thanks to
Sheer Force
and its Life Orb, but a
Water
Pokémon with an Ice attack can take care of it quickly.
Archeops
' undoing lies in its
Defeatist
Ability; wear its health halfway down, and its impressive offenses are cut in half. Her
Haxorus
excels in Attack and Speed, but
Dragon Dance
raises them to levels that could rip your team apart, and its Focus Sash prevents a one-hit knockout.
