Route 20
is a road that connects
Floccesy Town
and
Virbank City
. A river runs from the south all the way to
Floccesy Ranch
in the north. In autumn, the fallen leaves change the scenery dramatically. Hiker Jerome blocks the stairway to the east side of the route for now, and
Hugh
is nowhere to be found on the west side. He must have gone to
Floccesy Ranch
, so cross the bridge and head north.

After the battle, you deliver the extra
Town Map
to him. Just then, the ranch owner and his wife appear. She hands you a
Potion
, and he asks if either of you have seen their missing
Herdier
.
Hugh
gets angry at him for his careless attitude, and runs off to search for the dog. It's not in the pastures, so check the forest to the north. Hugh catches up to you near Janitor Orville to give you a
Parlyz Heal
. Go east to reach a grass patch with another Potion, then turn south to reach a clearing, where Herdier is cornered by a
Team Plasma Grunt
. Hugh dashes off to notify the owner, and the thug throws
TM21
(
Frustration
) at you as a distraction while he escapes.
Now that you have delivered the extra Town Map and found the lost Herdier, you can return to
Floccesy Town
to have
Alder
help train your Pokémon.

When you step outside, you meet a man named Mr. Medal. He gives you a

, which lets you participate in the Medal Rally competition. You can earn a variety of
Medals
during your adventure by meeting various conditions, like finding hidden items or evolving a Pokémon. Talk to Mr. Medal in any Pokémon Center to receive them. There are 255 different Medals to collect. Once he leaves,

has reopened.

Cheren
's Pokémon all know the move
Work Up
, so defeat them quickly before getting hit by a powered-up attack. If you caught a
Riolu
in
Floccesy Ranch
, its
Fighting-type
attacks can inflict serious damage. If you're playing on Challenge Mode, then Riolu's Fighting-type attacks only inflict normal damage on
Pidove
so make use of
Mareep
's
Electric-type
attacks if you caught one in
Floccesy Ranch
. If you have a

or

, you can use

to counter
