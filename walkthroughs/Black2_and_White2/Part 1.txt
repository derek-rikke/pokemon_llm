Intro
After selecting
New Game
you are asked to choose your character's gender. This cannot be changed after selecting. The resident researcher of the
Unova
region,
Professor Juniper
, appears and introduces new Trainers to the Pokémon world. Her lecture is important for new players, though it's nothing new to veterans of the series. She also introduces the player's rival,
Hugh
. Once she is done talking, you are asked to enter your character's and your rival's names. The name cannot be changed, so double-check that you have what you want. Press
OK
and you are ready for your adventure!
Aspertia City
Aspertia City
Your journey begins in
Aspertia City
, on the western edge of
Unova
. The Aspertia Outlook on the north side of the city offers a fantastic view of the region, spreading out to the north. The
Aspertia Gym
is located in the backyard of the Trainers' School, but the school is closed at the moment, so your challenge will have to wait.

Home
Mom starts talking to you as you try to leave home. She asks if you want a Pokémon and a
Pokédex
, so choose the obvious answer to show your determination to go on an adventure. She tells you that
Professor Juniper
's assistant,
Bianca
, is outside looking for you. The girl with the big green hat is not from around here, and may have gotten lost.
Outside, you meet your rival,
Hugh
. He already has a Pokémon, one he raised from an Egg, but wants someone to be his travelling partner. He offers to help you track down
Bianca
.
Aspertia Outlook
As you climb the stairway to the platform, Hugh is sure that Bianca is up there. Sure enough, she is here enjoying the view. She asks if you will help complete the
Pokédex
, so accept the task. Talk to her again and she shows you a container with three
Poké Balls
inside, giving you a chance to choose your new partner Pokémon.

The
Grass-type
Snivy
has the most weaknesses of the trio, with five:
Fire
-,
Bug
-,
Poison
-,
Flying
-, and
Ice-type
attacks. However, it and its evolutions make up for this with their
superior
defenses
. Its Grass attacks are strong against
Rock
-,
Ground
-, and
Water-type
Pokémon.
The
Fire-type
Tepig
is great when battling
Grass
-,
Bug
-,
Ice
-, and
Steel-type
Pokémon, but is vulnerable to
Water
-,
Ground
-, and
Rock-type
attacks. Tepig is unique amongst the Unova first partner Pokémon due to it gaining a secondary type as it grows, while Snivy and Oshawott do not. The
Fighting-type
adds two weaknesses,
Flying
and
Psychic
, but eliminates the Rock-type weakness. With their ability to learn Fighting moves (albeit
only
two
naturally) as well as Fire attacks, Tepig's evolutions have the most type advantages of the first partner evolutions, with the added edge against
Normal
-,
Rock
-, and
Dark-type
Pokémon.
The
Water-type
Oshawott
has an advantage when facing
Fire
-,
Rock
-, and
Ground-type
Pokémon, but may struggle against
Grass
- and
Electric-type
attacks. With only these two disadvantages even in its final form, Oshawott is arguably the safest choice of the three first partners.
After choosing a Pokémon, Bianca asks if you would like to give it a nickname. After that, she hands over your very own
Pokédex
! When you try to leave, Hugh walks up and asks Bianca for his own Pokédex; luckily for him, she has an extra one. Then he challenges you to a battle.

There is very little strategy to this battle. Regardless of which two Pokémon battle, they each have a similar moveset, so neither has an advantage. The fight will be over in three turns, barring a critical hit. If you win, you earn
$
500 and your Pokémon gains enough
experience
to reach level 6. If you lose, it's not the end of the world at all and nothing bad happens, other than you missing out on the money. Don't feel bad if you do lose, though.
Pokémon Center
Hugh
leaves, and
Bianca
leads you off for a tour of the local
Pokémon Center
. These hospitals restore your Pokémon to full health and eliminate any status ailments that may afflict them. She gives you a brief description of the
PC
, which has not changed much. Finally, she leads you to the
Poké Mart
counter, where you can buy and sell items. Before she leaves, she gives you ten
Poké Balls
to start you on your journey. Nice!
When you step outside, your Mom and Hugh's sister will show up. Mom gives you a pair of
Running Shoes
, which let you run by holding down the B Button. Hugh's sister gives you a
Town Map
, a map of the
Unova
region. She also gives you an extra map to take to her brother, who has already ventured out to
Route 19
. Next, Bianca tells you that she will demonstrate how to catch a Pokémon, so follow her north through the gate. The attendant inside gives you a free
Potion
on your way through.
Route 19
Route 19
Route 19
is a short road that connects
Aspertia City
and
Floccesy Town
. It is located at the base of a mountain, so the north side of the route is lined with cliffs.

is waiting just outside the gate. She demonstrates how to catch wild Pokémon by catching a wild
Purrloin
in the tall grass, and explains a bit more about registering the data in the Pokédex. Once she leaves, follow the path eastward where a man named
Alder
calls down to you from atop the cliff. This powerful Trainer offers to help train your Pokémon a little before jumping down and leading you to his home in
Floccesy Town
.

Floccesy Town
In the center of
Floccesy Town
is a clock tower for which the town is famous. To the north is
Pledge Grove
, a tiny forest that is said to have a connection to
a mythical Pokémon
. When you meet
Alder
on the north side of town, he asks why you have two
Town Maps
, and after hearing your explanation, tells you that
Hugh
has been seen on
Route 20
.
