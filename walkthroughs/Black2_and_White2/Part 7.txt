Bianca's HM
As you leave
Nimbasa
,
Bianca
catches up to you. She gives you
HM02
(
Fly
), which lets you instantly return to any familiar city or town. Use it on something like
Pidove
or
Sigilyph
.
Hidden Grottoes Revealed
After handing over the HM,
Bianca
claims that she hears something. She leads you north, where she hears a rustling in the trees. She explains that this must be a
Hidden Grotto
, one of many scattered across the region. These grottoes are hard to find, they simply look like a large shadow under a group of trees. Inside, you can meet a Pokémon with its
Hidden Ability
, a visible item, or a hidden item. After a while, another Pokémon may show up, or another item may appear. This grotto happens to have a
Minccino
inside, which has its Hidden Ability
Skill Link
. Bianca leaves you to catch it, or not, on your own.
The Berry Seller
A woman near the gate sells a bunch of five Berries every day for
$
200. These bunches may be
Pomeg
,
Kelpsy
,
Qualot
,
Hondew
, or
Grepa Berries
. She only sells one bunch per day.
The Hungry Maid
The Maid inside the trailer is trying to cook a meal, but is looking for more ingredients. If you give her
any edible item
, like
Berry Juice
or
Casteliacone
, she will pay for your generosity. The items she receives are worth anywhere from
$
20 to
$
30,000.
Battle the Musician
Defeat Musician Preston to receive a new
Prop
for the
Pokémon Musical
, an Electric Guitar.
Roadblock
A large crowd is gathered on the west side of the route. The drawbridge is blocked by a Motorcyclist, his name... Charles. A male Ace Trainer asks for help, so get ready to battle. Charles challenges you to a
Rotation Battle
B2
or a
Triple Battle
W2
, so check the order of your party members.

The crowd disperses when Charles is defeated, and you can proceed west over the drawbridge.
Driftveil Drawbridge
The Driftveil Drawbridge
The
Driftveil Drawbridge
is managed by the Driftveil Gym Leader, and is raised and lowered to accommodate the city's shipping schedule. Bird Pokémon frequently fly over the bridge, and may drop a few
feathers
. All but one of the seven varieties can be used to raise a Pokémon's
Effort values
. Most of these can also be sold for
$
1500, making them a handy source of quick cash. Sometimes
Ducklett
may rest on the bridge, as well.
Funfest Mission
By talking to the man on the east end of the bridge, the
Funfest Mission
Wings Falling on the Drawbridge
will be added.
The Youngster's Wish
In the center of the bridge stands a Youngster. He would like to see a
Charizard
, for which the bridge is nicknamed. If you speak to him with one in your party, he hands over a
Heal Powder
as thanks.
Driftveil City
Driftveil City
B
W
Driftveil City
is a major port city that distributes a large variety of goods. The Driftveil Market sells items found nowhere else in
Unova
. The city was developed considerably over the last two years, and is now filled with many hotels. In the northwest, construction has begun on
Clay Tunnel
, a shortcut to
Twist Mountain
, which is still ongoing.

Team Plasma, Old & New
On your way into the city, you meet a former member of
Team Plasma
arguing with a current member, who is trying to convince his friend to rejoin the group. He refuses, saying that it will make his lord
N
sad. The current member laughs, calling the team's former "king" a traitor who disappeared when they needed him.
Hugh
arrives suddenly and the current member runs off, with Hugh not far behind. The former member invites you to hear more of their history at their old base, west of the Gym.
Grand Hotel
Grand Hotel Driftveil stands near the stone bridge. Speak to the old man on the first floor; if you have seen at least 70 different Pokémon, he rewards you with a
Shell Bell
. After that, take the elevator to 19F and play with the
Axew
to receive the
Haban Berry
it was holding.
Luxury Suites
Driftveil Luxury Suites sits in the southwest. On the first floor, a Lady asks to see a Pokémon with a certain move; fulfill her request to receive a
Heart Scale
. She asks to see a new move every day. On 23F, a Waiter gives you an
Everstone
.
Continental Hotel
The Driftveil Continental Hotel is located in the northeast part of the city. Talk to the Veteran on 25F to receive a
Big Root
.
Chateau Hotel
The Chateau Hotel can be found north of the Market. On the first floor, you meet a master Move Tutor who is interested in
Red Shards
. Give him a certain number of them to have him teach a Pokémon a new move. On 25F, a Gentleman gives you an
Air Balloon
.
Move Tutor
The house next to the Chateau Hotel belongs to the local Move Tutor. He is obsessed with
Red Shards
, and will teach a variety of moves for the right number of Shards. The Driftveil Gym's weaknesses include
Ice
- and
Grass-type
attacks, so you may want to have him teach
Ice Punch
or
Seed Bomb
.

Afterwards,
Hugh
shows up and
Rood
leads you both into the building. Rood explains how he and the other former Plasma members are repenting for their misdeeds from two years ago. Hugh asks where is his sister's missing purrloin but Rood suggests that Team Plasma is still using it. Hugh now leaves to defeat the Pokemon Gym. Rood then asks you to look after a Pokémon for him, a
Zorua
that once traveled with
N
.
Driftveil Gym
Driftveil Gym
Driftveil City Pokémon Gym
Leader: Clay
The Underground Boss
The
Driftveil Gym
specializes in
Ground-type
Pokémon. In keeping with his Miner King title,
Clay
has established his Gym in a large underground cavern littered with green crystals. To reach the Gym Leader in the northeast, challengers must navigate a series of conveyor belts through the shadowy chamber. A spotlight snaps on over each platform you visit, and there are four platforms that function as lifts so you can get a better view of your surroundings.
Clay
's favorite move,
Bulldoze
, lowers his opponent's
Speed
when it hits. To counter this, give your fighters a
Quick Claw
to let them sometimes attack first. As for his team, all three (or four, if you're playing Challenge Mode) of Clay's Pokémon are weakened by
Water-type
attacks. As an alternative, his
Krokorok
and
Sandslash
are both vulnerable to
Grass-type
moves- while Krokorok,
Onix
and
Excadrill
are afraid of
Fighting-type
moves.

For defeating him,
Clay
awards you the
Quake Badge
, which ensures that all Pokémon of level 60 or less obey. He also gives you
TM78
(
Bulldoze
) as a prize.
Clay then leads you out of the Gym, where you meet up with
Hugh
again. Clay invites the two of you to the
Pokémon World Tournament
located south of the city. Hugh rages against Clay for letting former members of
Team Plasma
live in his city; while Clay tries to calm him down, Hugh does not seem convinced and runs off to the south. Follow him to the World Tournament area.
