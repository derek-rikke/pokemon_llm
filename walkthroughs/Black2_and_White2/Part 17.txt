Daily Battles against Hugh
Pokémon World Tournament
Entering the
Hall of Fame
unlocks the
Unova Leaders Tournament
, the first of the specialty tournaments. This lets you battle against the local Gym Leaders, both current and former. After winning there, you can challenge the Gym Leaders of
Kanto
,
Johto
,
Hoenn
, and
Sinnoh
in their own tournaments. Winning each of these unlocks the
World Leaders Tournament
, and after ten victories here, the
Champions Tournament
is unlocked.
Clay Tunnel
Clay Tunnel
Clay Tunnel
was created by
the local Gym Leader
's constant mining. Stretching out beneath the region's western peninsula, it connects
Driftveil City
,
Mistralton Cave
, and
Twist Mountain
. The deepest area houses the mysterious
Underground Ruins
, which contains
Regirock
and either
Registeel
(if playing Black 2) or
Regice
(if playing White 2). In order to fully explore Clay Tunnel, you will need to have
Strength
and
Surf
available, and it may be a good idea to stock up on
Dusk Balls
for the Regis in the Underground Ruins.

Southern Cave
Go north past Hiker Teppei, and check the rock to the left for a
Blue Shard
. There is also a
Full Heal
hidden on the ground near the Strength boulder. Further north, a group of Workers is trying to clear a path to the next cave; if you have access to
Rock Smash
, you can help clear the way. If not, go east from Hiker Teppei and ride the mine cart to the next cave instead.
Western Cave
Move the northeast boulder into place, then go south to get a
Red Shard
. Head west past Hiker Manuel to reach a second boulder; moving this one into place lets you reach an
HP Up
and a
Nugget
. Inspect the rock on the southwest side of the pond to find a
Water Stone
, then wade out to the island to reach a hidden
Steel Gem
. Continue north to reach a fork in the road; the western path leads to
Mistralton Cave
, while the northern path leads to the next cave.
Northern Cave
Defeat Pokémon Ranger Maxwell to receive a
Lum Berry
, then follow the dead-end path to the west to get a
Metal Coat
. Head north past Worker Leo, and pick up the
Max Revive
on the north side of the pond. Continue north past Worker Brand and defeat Pokémon Ranger Katie for another
Lum Berry
. If you head north from here, you can get to Twist Mountain. Instead, go east and then jump into the mine cart.
Southern Cave
Head south and move the boulder into place, creating a shortcut to the entrance and allowing you to reach a
Rare Bone
to the southeast. Turn around, pick up the
Green Shard
, and talk to the Worker to ride the next mine cart.
Eastern Cave
Talk to the Worker to continue your ride through the tunnel.
Northern Cave
Surf north across the pond, inspect the small rocks to find an
Iron
, and step through the doorway.
Eastern Cave
Shove the boulder into place, then take the next mine cart.
Northern Cave
Go north and check the rock to find a
Big Nugget
, then step through the doorway to the east.
Underground Ruins
The first chamber of the
Underground Ruins
has little more than a circular pattern on the floor. Go through the double-doors to find four statues, and examine the second from the right for a hint. The hint shown depends on the time of day, and differs between the morning and evening hours. Stand on the center of the eye pattern, then take six steps south and ??? steps east. Check the ground to find a hidden switch; once pressed, the north part of the cave becomes the Rock Peak Chamber. Head north to the back of the cave to find
Regirock
, one of
Hoenn
's
legendary giants
! Wear it down quickly with
Grass
- and
Water-type
moves, then weaken it further with
Fire
- and
Flying-type
attacks.

When the battle concludes,
Zinzolin
approaches from the south. To atone for his misdeeds, he gives you a few of
Ghetsis
's research documents. He claims they can help decipher the ancient script found in the underwater ruins. The script uses coded language, which uses different rules for encryption on each floor. Talk to Zinzolin every time you reach a new floor to receive clues to help crack the code. Fully exploring the ruins requires the use of
Flash
and
Strength
.
Cynthia, Champion of Sinnoh
Step inside the easternmost villa to meet
Cynthia
, Champion of the
Sinnoh
region. When you first meet her, she will battle you regardless of the season. After that, you can battle her once per day during the spring. Her Pokémon are very high-leveled, so train against her team while you can. Her Pokémon will aim for your weaknesses, so be sure to do the same to them. Just remember that her
Spiritomb
has no weaknesses (
Normal
-,
Fighting
-, and
Psychic-type
attacks have no effect on Spiritomb).

Abyssal Ruins
Abyssal Ruins
The
Abyssal Ruins
are believed to be the remains of an ancient temple, the tomb of an ancient king that sank beneath the waves. No one knows who built it or why, but an explanation may lie with the odd symbols etched into the walls. When you dive down to the ruins, hold down the Control Pad as you descend or the currents will wash you back to the surface.

Each of the four dive points connect to the same large room on the first floor. All items can be reached from any entrance. Upon entering the rubble, the sound of a switch can be heard. You will only be able to travel 500 steps before the currents rush you back to the surface. To reach the second floor, you must reach the center of the room in 190 steps or less. Inspect the purple pillar there and it slides out of the way. Behind it is a spot where you can float up to the second floor.
2F
The second floor is a lot smaller than the first. Swim to the south and take the second right. Work your way up to the northeast corner, and swim along the north wall. Head south then west to reach a purple pillar; use
Flash
directly beside it and it will move out of the way. Go either north or south to reach the third floor.
3F
Behind you to the west is a
Relic Vase
. To the north is a
Relic Statue
; to the south, a
Relic Gold
. A
Relic Band
lies in the center of the room, and a
Relic Silver
is off to the south. Two more Relic Bands and a Relic Vase lie to the east. To ascend to the final floor, stand at the purple pillar in the center of the east wall and use
Strength
.
4F
There's almost nothing here, except for a few more purple pillars and a single item in the middle of the room — the
Relic Crown
. This is the last of the ruins' treasures, so just wander around a bit until the currents wash you to the surface. All totaled, the relics housed here can be sold to the collector in the western villa for a combined
