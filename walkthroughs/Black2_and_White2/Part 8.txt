Pokémon World Tournament
The Pokémon World Tournament
The
Pokémon World Tournament
is a facility south of
Driftveil City
that stands on the former
Cold Storage
site. Famous Pokémon Trainers from around the world gather here to compete against one another. Outside the building, several vendors stand ready to teach new moves to the competitors' Pokémon. To the west, the north side of the
Relic Passage
can be found.

Hidden Power Guy
The man in the northwest booth is able to see what type of
Hidden Power
a Pokémon will have. If you plan to teach the move, be sure to see what he has to say.
Move Reminder
The girl in the southwest booth is the Move Reminder. For the price of one
Heart Scale
per transaction, she will re-teach an old move that your Pokémon has forgotten.
Move Deleter
East of the Move Reminder is the Move Deleter. This old man can help a Pokémon forget one of its moves, even HM moves that can't normally be forgotten.
Ultimate Move Tutor
The old man at the southeast booth can teach an ultimate move to any fully-evolved starter Pokémon. However, it must share a strong bond with its Trainer. The quiet
Grass
Pokémon like
Serperior
can learn
Frenzy Plant
, the blazing
Fire
Pokémon like
Emboar
can learn
Blast Burn
, and the restless
Water
Pokémon like
Samurott
can learn
Hydro Cannon
.
Battle-Combo Move Tutor
The man in the easternmost booth teaches a special move to any members of the starter Pokémon families.
Grass-type
Pokémon like the
Snivy
family can learn
Grass Pledge
,
Fire-type
Pokémon like the
Tepig
family can learn
Fire Pledge
, and
Water-type
Pokémon like the
Oshawott
family can learn
Water Pledge
. Using these moves on the same turn in a Double or Triple Battle will raise their power to 150, and activate additional effects.
Types Involved
Description
Creates a sea of fire where all non-
Fire
Pokémon lose 1/8 of their max
HP
every turn for four turns
Creates a rainbow that doubles the likelihood of a move's additional effect(s) for four turns
Creates a vast swamp that reduces the opponent's
Speed
by 50% for four turns
World Tournament building
Hugh
and
Clay
are waiting outside the PWT building. When you approach, the Gym Leader proudly guides the two of you into the elaborate tournament hall. Inside is
Cheren
, who was busy investigating something when he was strong-armed by Clay into participating. Follow him and Hugh north to register in the tournament.
Driftveil Tournament
Three consecutive victories are needed to win the
Driftveil Tournament
. The use of items is prohibited during the tournament, so hand out items to your Pokémon before registering. Opponents are not usually decided ahead of time, but for your first tournament, you will need to defeat
Hugh
,
Cheren
, and
Colress
.

After earning 1
BP
for winning the tournament, Roxie comes and tells that she will join the tournament. Clay thanks us for making Driftveil City popular and then leaves. Now head outside to see
Team Plasma
members passing by the building.
Colress
tries to stop
Hugh
from chasing them, but he doesn't listen, and follows them south to the pier. Rest up before following him.
Plasma Frigate
A large ship is moored at the pier. Go with Hugh and
Cheren
to storm the ship, which turns out to be
Team Plasma's base of operations
. The three of you are immediately surrounded by a crowd of Grunts. Defeat the first two on your own, then team up with Cheren then Hugh to take out the others.

Zinzolin
, one of the
Seven Sages
, emerges from the ship and declares that Team Plasma will rule
Unova
. He calls the
Shadow Triad
to appear, and they whisk the three of you off of the ship. Hugh runs off in a huff, and Cheren sets out for
Route 6
.
Relic Passage
Relic Passage
The
Relic Passage
is a large underground cave that was only recently discovered. It connects the
Pokémon World Tournament
and the
Castelia Sewers
. One of the tunnels leads to the lowest floor of the
Relic Castle
, buried deep under the desert sands. The
dust clouds
that randomly pop up not only give you a chance of encountering a wild
Drilbur
or
Onix
, but it also gives you a chance of acquiring a random
colored shard
. This can help with collecting the shards you need to trade in to a Move Tutor for your Pokémon to learn any compatible move they offer.
