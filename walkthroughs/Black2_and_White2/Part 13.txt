Opelucid City
Opelucid Gym
Opelucid City Pokémon Gym
Leader: Drayden
The Spartan Mayor
The
Opelucid Gym
specializes in
Dragon-type
Pokémon, which are only vulnerable to
Ice
- and Dragon-type attacks. The Gym consists of two large dragon statues, one near the entrance and the other at the rear wall. Challengers must defeat at least one Trainer from each level to advance. First off, defeat Veteran Lucius to activate the switch on the first dragon's neck; this elevates you to the level of the next two Trainers. On the left, Veteran Rhona prefers fighting defensively, while Veteran Jerry on the right favors offense. Defeat at least one to reach the next level. On the left, Veteran Denae fights in a
Rotation Battle
, while Veteran Ron on the right fights in a
Triple Battle
. Once they fall, your statue rises to
Drayden
's level and the two statues butt heads, allowing you to reach the Gym Leader.
Consider having a Move Tutor teach some new moves;
Dual Chop
and
Ice Punch
are available in
Driftveil
, while
Icy Wind
and
Dragon Pulse
can be taught in
Lentimas
. Avoid using
Grass
-,
Fire
-,
Water
-, or
Electric-type
attacks, as dragons are resistant to such moves.
Druddigon
's
Revenge
makes its opponent pay for not knocking it out in one hit, while
Crunch
deals extra damage from its
Sheer Force
Ability.
Flygon
's
Rock Slide
nails any Ice-type opponent aiming for its double-weakness, and
Earth Power
can also inflict serious damage. Lastly, his
Haxorus
starts with high
Attack
and can boost it (and
Speed
) even further with
Dragon Dance
, so knock it out as soon as possible! All three dragons share the
Dragon Tail
attack, which forces the damaged opponent to switch out.

Defeated,
Drayden
awards you the
Legend Badge
, which ensures that all Pokémon of level 80 or less will obey you. He also gives you
TM82
(
Dragon Tail
) as a prize.
Drayden's Story
Drayden
shows you to his home, where he tells the story of the two dragons, the legend of
Kyurem
, and the history of his family heirloom.
Let me tell you the story. It's a long story, but listen closely. It was two years ago when the two dragon Pokémon were awakened. The black dragon Pokémon,
Zekrom
, pursued what is ideal, with the desire to usher in a new world of hope. And the white dragon Pokémon,
Reshiram
, sought what is true, with the desire to usher in a new world of goodness. Zekrom and Reshiram were once a single Pokémon. You may wonder why it split in two. The single dragon Pokémon had helped the twin heroes bring a new region into being. But the twin heroes--the older brother who sought the truth and the younger brother who sought ideals--sundered the region in two as they fought to see which of them was right. In that desperate hour, the single dragon Pokémon split its body into a black Pokémon and a white Pokémon, even though ideals and truth don't need to be in opposition! As the story goes, a third dragon Pokémon,
Kyurem
, also came into existence in that era. And there may be proof of this to be found in a treasure passed down in my family for generations: the
DNA Splicers
.
Professor Juniper
's research determined that the materials in the splicers date back to the same era as the materials used in building the
Dragonspiral Tower
. Oh, the DNA Splicers are stored very safely. I guard them because I don't know what kind of power might lie within them. But here's what's been bothering me... Could there be one more dragon Pokémon? Even if Kyurem really exists, we don't know what kind of Pokémon it is. For starters, the two Pokémon the ancient Pokémon split into are both overwhelmingly powerful. So if Kyurem exists, could it be just a husk--a shell that was left over?
Team Plasma Attacks!
The building is rocked by a sudden tremor. Outside, the
Plasma Frigate
approaches from the sky. It readies its cannon and fires a few shots of ice at the city. Every shot freezes a part of the city, leaving the area difficult to navigate.
Drayden
doesn't appreciate this and sends his
Haxorus
to smash the nearest ice crystal, but it doesn't work.
Zinzolin
appears and demands that Drayden hand over the
DNA Splicers
. He refuses, but the Sage won't give up so easily. He sends his Grunts to search for the splicers, and the Gym Leader asks that you track them down.

After that, track down the third Grunt to the south of the Gym. When all three are defeated, return to the Gym to take on
Zinzolin
. Use
Fire
- and

moves to bring the battle to a quick end.

Unfortunately, this

did not have the splicers. He vanishes, and

runs over to see if you are alright. Just then,
Hugh
and

call on the

. They saw the ship attack the city, and Cheren is headed there now. He says that
Humilau City
has the lowest temperature readings in the region right now, so

Marine Tube
The

, the path features a transparent dome so that visitors can see the various ocean-dwelling Pokémon.
Wailord

Medal
.

Home is Where the Heart Scales Are
A Nurse with a
Stunfisk
lives in the northeast house. She likes flat Pokémon, and will give out five
Heart Scales
if you speak to her with a
Luvdisc
in your party. Luvdisc can only be caught by fishing, but the Super Rod is not obtained until later.
Humilau Gym
Humilau Gym
Humilau City Pokémon Gym
Leader: Marlon
More Splash Than The Sea
The marshy
Humilau Gym
specializes in
Water-type
Pokémon, so
Grass
- and
Electric-type
attacks will work best. To reach the Gym Leader, challengers must move from dock to dock by floating on large lily pads. When stepped on, they move in the same direction until they hit an obstacle. When they hit each other, the first stops and the second moves on. Jump on the first lily pad to reach the southwest dock, and ride the second one eastward. Climb onto the dock and go east to fight Ace Trainer Melina. Float south to the next dock and loop around to reach the bridge. To reach Ace Trainer Santino, ride the nearby pad south then east; this moves another pad into place, letting you continue along the east wall. Take on Ace Trainer Jeanne and cross the water to reach the northwest dock. Float north to reach Ace Trainer Sable, then south to reach Ace Trainer Enzio. Repeat the same clockwise loop to reach
Marlon
.
Marlon
's
Carracosta
tends to start things off with
Shell Smash
, which cuts its defenses but raises its
Attack
,
Special Attack
, and
Speed
. In addition, its
Sturdy
Ability prevents it from being taken out in one shot.
Wailord
can hit opposing
Grass-type
Pokémon with
Bounce
, but otherwise its low defenses make it a big target. His
Jellicent
can be difficult to take down, especially with
Recover
. Keep your Pokémon's health above 50% to avoid its powered-up
Brine
attack. All three of Marlon's Pokémon know the move
Scald
, so watch out for
burns
!

Upon his defeat,
Marlon
awards you the
Wave Badge
, which ensures that all Pokémon will obey without question. He also hands over
TM55
(
Scald
) as a prize before swimming off.
Outside,
Hugh
congratulates you on winning your eighth Badge, and reminds you that
Team Plasma
is still up to no good.
Marlon
stops by, asking if Team Plasma is actually bad or not. He follows a policy of "the ocean accepts all rivers", and as a result does not seem bothered by the group's wrongdoings. He refuses to help track them down, and just walks away. Hugh asks that you investigate
Route 22
to the west. Stock up on
Ultra Balls
before you go, as
another legendary
is found nearby!
Route 22
Route 22
The uneven terrain of
Route 22
makes the scenery almost maze-like. Raised walkways connect some elevated areas, while most of the tall grass lies below. The route stretches between
Humilau City
to the east and the
Giant Chasm
to the west.

Terrakion is waiting
The third member of the
Swords of Justice
is found in the center of
Route 22
. It seems that it, like
Cobalion
and
Virizion
, was also waiting for you. Upon approaching it, you are interrupted by
Colress
. He says that you will need the strength to protect your Pokémon in order to fight
Team Plasma
. He gives you the
Colress MCHN
, and before he leaves mentions that something he saw in
Seaside Cave
reminded him of meeting you on
Route 4
.
Start off with
Grass
-,
Water
-, or
Ground-type
attacks to wear
Terrakion
down fast, then follow up with
Fire
-,
Poison
-, or
Bug-type
moves to weaken it further. Avoid using
Dark-type
attacks, as its
Justified
Ability raises its
Attack
when it is damaged by those moves. If you happen to defeat it, Terrakion will reappear after entering the
Hall of Fame
.

Return to Humilau
The
Giant Chasm
is accessible at this point, but cannot be fully explored. Instead, follow the raised walkways southeastward to reach a large boulder, and use
Strength
to create a shortcut for later. Take
Colress
' advice and head for
Seaside Cave
on
Route 21
, south of
Humilau City
.
