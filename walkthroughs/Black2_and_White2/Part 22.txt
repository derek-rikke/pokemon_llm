Reversal Mountain
Locate the trainer Doctor Derek first and use the stairway near him to reach the section of BF1 where Heatran's chamber is located. Once you are ready, save and then use the Magma Stone to unveil Heatran then interact with it to face it in battle. Once in battle, paralyze it and then weaken it as best you can with moves that do neutral damage to Heatran. Then swap in a good
Water-type
to help take the damage from the
Fire
and
Steel-type
moves as you try to catch Heatran.

The Nature Preserve
The
Nature Preserve
was established as a secret haven for Pokémon, so far away from

that the only way to reach it is by airplane from
Mistralton City
. The grove is home to many kinds of Pokémon that cannot be found anywhere else, including some that have reached level 100!
