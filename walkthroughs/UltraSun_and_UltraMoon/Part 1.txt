Choosing a Passport photo
The player is immediately given a choice of several languages—English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, and Simplified and Traditional Chinese—in which to play. After that, they receive a video call from the resident researcher of the
Alola
region,
Professor Kukui
. As the character,
Elio
/
Selene
, is preparing to move to the tropical region with his/her
mother
, the professor welcomes them and gives a brief introduction to the Pokémon world. Next, Kukui asks the player to choose one of eight photos for his/her new
Trainer Passport
. This allows for the choice between gender and skin tone, which cannot be changed; clothing, eye color, as well as hair length and color can be customized later on. Finally, the professor asks for the Trainer's name, which can be up to twelve characters long. Kukui then ends the call, and the character's mother calls for help with packing away their belongings.
A short cutscene shows a mysterious girl and her unidentified Pokémon trying to escape a group of security guards dressed in white, and pale skinned people in futuristic blue and white outfits. Just when it seems that there is no escape, the Pokémon uses its power to teleport the pair to safety. The scene ends with the game's title and logo appearing on-screen.
Please note there is a
12-hour offset
in Ultra Moon, where the game runs 12 hours ahead of the real time clock on the 3DS
