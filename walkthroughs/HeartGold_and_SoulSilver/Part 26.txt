Cinnabar Island
The remains of Cinnabar Island
At some point during the last few years, the volcanic
Cinnabar Island
erupted. The Pokémon Center has been rebuilt, but the rest of the town remains either buried in rubble or swept into the sea. It is here that you meet
Blue
, contemplating the power of nature. The former Champion and current Gym Leader refuses to return to his post at the
Viridian Gym
. In order to persuade him, you must first collect the seven other Kanto Gym Badges. To earn the seventh, you need to track down the Gym Leader of the displaced
Cinnabar Gym
. With the building destroyed,
Blaine
was forced to relocate to a cave in the
Seafoam Islands
to the east.

Blaine
's quiz machines were destroyed, so there are no puzzles to solve. However, none of his six Gym Trainers will approach when you step into their line of sight. Each one is stationed at a choke-point and will not move until they are defeated. To reach the central area, it is necessary to approach from the western side, as Super Nerd Merle is the only one of the three nearest the Gym Leader that does not block the path upon defeat.
The Gym Leader is a
Fire-type
specialist, so you may want to bring a few
Burn Heals
. All three of his Pokémon are susceptible to
Water
- and
Ground-type
moves, but his
Magcargo
is especially vulnerable. Though his Pokémon are at respectable levels, they still should not pose much of a threat at this point. Despite this, Water Pokémon should still be careful of
Magmar
's
ThunderPunch
. Each of his Pokémon carries a
White Herb
, which prevents
Overheat
's
Special Attack
drop for a single turn.

When you first descend into the icy caves, you begin in the southeastern part of B1F. Move the boulders aside and collect the
Grip Claw
in the dead-end path to the north. Walk up onto the nearest platform to reach an
Ice Heal
and climb down the northernmost ladder.

lying hidden between two stalagmites. Take the ladder down to B4F.

Go north to find
TM13
(

B3F
Go southwest to find three blocks sitting on an ice patch. Clear two of the three blocks out of the way by bumping into them from the north or south, sending them skidding away. Approach the third block from the east, which creates a stopping point that will allow you to continue westward. Another ice patch lies a short distance to the northwest. Bump the northeast block from the south, push the northwest block from the west, then slide clockwise from the southern edge of the ice to reach the
Big Pearl
. Climb down the ladder to the southwest.

legendary birds
. Begin the battle with

Steel-type
