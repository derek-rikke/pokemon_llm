Ruins of Alph
The grounds where the
Ruins of Alph
are located can be reached from
Route 32
to the east and
Route 36
to the north. There are four interior chambers. Each chamber holds a puzzle in which tiles must be arranged to show the image of a specific Pokémon species. Completing each puzzle causes a series of
Unown
forms to begin appearing in the large hall beneath the complex. The mysterious Pokémon species appears in
many different forms
that all resemble letters of the alphabet. Unown's encounter rate is evenly divided among all unlocked forms.
Each chamber also features a message in Unown script on the rear wall. Deciphering this message and using the correct item or field move reveals a doorway to hidden room filled with items.

. Dropping down through the hole at the back wall leads to a hidden room above the underground hall, where a message in Unown script can be found on the floor:
OUR CLAN ENGRAVED WORDS IN THIS PLACE
Our clan engraved words in this place
In the entry room, a bit of text beside the puzzle hints at the Pokémon's identity. Move the tiles to their proper place to reveal the Pokémon's image and complete the puzzle. Doing so causes the floor to fall away, dropping you into the underground hall where the first ten forms of
Unown
have awakened. This draws the attention of a researcher, who notices your talent for archaeology and gives you the
Unown Report
. This device records the limited data available on each of the Unown forms.

SlowpokeTail
" for the special price of
$
1,000,000. When he realizes that you do not have the cash, he shooes you away.

Visit the Pokémon Center to rest your weary team and prepare for the upcoming cave. Speak to the Fisherman near the counter to receive an
Old Rod

fishing
rod, you can now cast your line at any body of water to reel in

Pokémon. The Old Rod is a low-end model, and is often only able to hook

Ruins of Alph
.
