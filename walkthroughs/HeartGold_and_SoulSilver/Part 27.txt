Viridian Gym
Welcome to
Viridian Gym
, the last of the Kanto League. The Gym Leader,
Blue
, is the only one around that does not specialize in any single type, and instead uses the team from his time as Champion
three years ago
. He has installed a maze of spinner tiles to thwart any would-be challengers. Similar to the
Blackthorn Gym
, the unstable floor causes your lead Pokémon to retreat to its Poké Ball. To reach the Gym Leader, step only on red tiles, beginning with the one in the southeast. Go west from the first stopper tile, then north, northeast, and east twice to reach the end.
With a diverse team and great movesets, Blue is the most challenging opponent you have faced at this point. He leads with his
Exeggutor
, and its
Trick Room
will likely allow it,
Machamp
, and
Rhydon
to outspeed the competition temporarily; it can also cause status problems with
Hypnosis
. Hit it with
Bug-type
moves for massive damage. His
Arcanine
knows the powerful
Flare Blitz
, as well as
Dragon Pulse
and
ExtremeSpeed
for coverage; use
Special moves
to bypass its
Intimidate
Ability.
Rhydon
can deal serious damage with
Earthquake
and
Stone Edge
. Use
Water
-,
Grass
-, or
Ground-type
moves to take it down, but Water and Grass Pokémon should be wary of its
Thunder Fang
and
Megahorn
, respectively. The combination of
Gyarados
'
Dragon Dance
,
Waterfall
, and
Ice Fang
can prove lethal, so knock it out quickly with
Electric-type
attacks. His Machamp's
No Guard
Ability ensures that
DynamicPunch
connects with the target, causing
Confusion
every time; take it out with a
Psychic-type
blast, as Stone Edge and
ThunderPunch
can deter
Flying-type
opponents. Finally, his
Pidgeot
relies on
Return
and
Air Slash
, and can mimic your previous attack with
Mirror Move
. Hit it with Electric-,
Rock
-, or
Ice-type
moves to bring the battle to an end.

When the smoke clears, Blue awards you the
Earth Badge
, the sixteenth and final Badge which enables the use of
Rock Climb
in the field. He also hands out
TM92
(
Trick Room
) as a prize.
Exit the Gym to receive a call from
Professor Oak
. He congratulates you on earning all eight Kanto Gym Badges, and asks that you visit the Lab.
Pallet Town
Oak's Pokémon Lab
In recognition of your victories over the eight Gyms of Kanto, Oak rewards you with
HM08
(
Rock Climb
). Now that you have earned all sixteen Badges, he grants you access to
Mt. Silver
, off to the northwest. The hallowed mountain is strictly off-limits to the average Trainer, but you have now proven yourself more than that. But before rushing off to that rugged, forbidding mountain, there are a few loose ends to resolve.
Now that you have Rock Climb (optional)
With the final HM
Rock Climb
in your possession, there are a multitude of helpful items you can obtain in both regions. If you plan on breeding, there are some helpful incenses to pick up. These incenses are the only way to obtain certain baby Pokémon like
Bonsly
,
Mantyke
, and
Munchlax
. There are also some valuable items such as the
Magmarizer
,
Dubious Disc
, and
Oval Stone
that can used to evolve Pokémon such as
Magmar
,
Porygon2
, and
Happiny
.

Cerulean Cave
Cerulean Cave
is a large network of maze-like tunnels that extend deep into the mountains on the outskirts of
Cerulean City
. The undeveloped cave is pitch-black inside, so using
Flash
is recommended.
Surf
,
Rock Smash
, and
Rock Climb
are also required to fully navigate the area. Bring a healthy supply of
Ultra Balls
or
Dusk Balls
, as a violent legendary Pokémon resides on the lowest floor.

Mewtwo
Having traversed the entire cave, you finally come face-to-face with
Mewtwo
. Use
Bug
-,
Ghost
-, and
Dark-type
attacks to drain its health quickly, then follow up with
Fighting
and
Poison
moves to wear it down further. Inflict status ailments like
Sleep
or
Paralysis
to increase your odds of capture, and launch a barrage of
Ultra Balls
or
Dusk Balls
. It has only one damaging move,
Psycho Cut
, so Dark-type opponents are immune to its assault. If you fail to catch it, defeat the Pokémon League once more to cause it to reappear.
