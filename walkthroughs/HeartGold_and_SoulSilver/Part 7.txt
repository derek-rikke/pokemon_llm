Mail Delivery
Speak to

in the southern gate, and he asks for a favor. Deliver his
Spearow
, named Kenya, and the piece of
Mail
it holds to his friend on
Route 31
. It is intended for the man dozing near the pond there. Complete the delivery, and he wakes up just long enough to give you
TM50
(
Nightmare
). Return here and speak to the guard afterward to receive an
HP Up
as a reward.
Cameron the Photographer
Enter the north gate and go left. If you speak to the first man, he introduces himself as
Cameron
the Photographer. He asks if you would like to have your photo taken, and if so, proceeds to take a snapshot of you alongside your party Pokémon.

Meet the Master
After exiting the gate, move north along the path to be met by an old man and his
Poliwrath
. He believes that your lead Pokémon is ready to participate in the
Pokéathlon
, and leads the way to the
Pokéathlon Dome
building. He invites you to take part in the athletic competitions held here, and introduces himself as
Magnus
, the venue's founder, before heading inside.
Aprijuice Stand
Using the Apriblender
A Typhlosion's performance
In the plaza to the west, there is a stand that offers Aprijuice for sale. Seeing a confused look on your face, the attendant gives you an
Apriblender
so that you may familiarize yourself with the beverage. This device is stored in the
Apricorn Box
and is used to blend Apricorns into Aprijuice, a type of drink that improves a Pokémon's athletic
performance
. Up to five Apricorns may be added to the Apriblender at once, after which the user must walk 100 steps in order to mix up the drink. Each cycle produces enough Aprijuice for three servings. Attributes including flavor level, mildness level, and taste all influence the drink's effect on a Pokémon. These effects are temporary, and wear off when the Pokémon is stored in the
PC
.
The stand's selection of Aprijuice includes three of five varieties, each having been developed by a popular Pokéathlete. Availability varies by the day.
Interior

Dress the Part
When you reach the front desk, you are approached by
Whitney
, who is also here to participate in the
Pokéathlon
. She is excited to enter the competition but is surprised at your outfit, and runs off for a moment before returning with a Jersey so that you may look your best. She suddenly remembers that she left her Pokémon behind, and leaves for
Goldenrod City
to retrieve them.
Courses
There are five courses to enter, with each prioritizing a single
performance
stat. Each course includes three events.
Course
Medal
Events
Speed
Hurdle Dash, Pennant Capture, and Relay Run
Power
Block Smash, Circle Push, and Goal Roll
Skill
Snow Throw, Goal Roll, and Pennant Capture
Stamina
Ring Drop, Relay Run, and Block Smash
Jump
Lamp Jump, Disc Catch, and Hurdle Dash
By winning courses, the participating Pokémon will earn medals for their species. Trainers earn points based on how well their team did and if they qualified for any bonuses. The Trainer with the highest score wins, with a tie settled with a random draw by the Pokéathlon host. A win will earn the Trainer an additional 100 points, which can be spent on prizes at the
Athlete Shop
, or
Data Cards
that may be used to see records of various actions, course wins and losses, and other statistics. Beating the records for all 10 of the events in the Pokéathlon increases the
Trainer Card
level.

Bug-Catching Contest
There is no entry fee for the
Bug-Catching Contest
. Anyone may enter once per day, every
Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday
.
To compete, Trainers must catch the single best
Bug-type
Pokémon they can find. To do this, Trainers are given 20
Sport Balls
and are only allowed to use a single Pokémon from their party. The others remain with the contest officials until the competition is over. Any Pokémon caught will be recorded in the Pokédex, but only one Pokémon may be kept to be judged. The Pokémon selected to be judged may be kept after the competition.
The competition ends when 20 minutes have passed, all
Sport Balls
have been used, or the Trainer
blacks out
, leaves the park, or chooses to quit. After that, the judging will occur, in which Trainers are scored on their skills of capturing rare and powerful Pokémon.

An Inconvenient Tree
The odd tree mentioned by the woman in

SquirtBottle
. Splash a bit of water on it, and it attacks! It turns out to be a
Sudowoodo
, a rare Pokémon that is more similar to a rock than a tree.
