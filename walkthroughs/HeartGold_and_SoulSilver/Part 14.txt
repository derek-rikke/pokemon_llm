New Bark Town
New Bark Town
Elm's Lab
When you return to Elm's Lab in
New Bark Town
,
Lyra
/
Ethan
is impressed that you have already collected eight
Badges
, and
Professor Elm
thanks you for helping with his research. To show his appreciation, he rewards you with a
Master Ball
, a rare model of Poké Ball that catches any Pokémon without fail! According to Elm, this type of Poké Ball is usually given only to recognized Pokémon researchers, but he thinks that you will make better use of it than he would. It is best to use it when battling a Legendary Pokémon, as they can be very difficult to capture otherwise. He also informs you that a group of
Kimono Girls
is looking for you, and is waiting at the
Ecruteak Dance Theater
.
Ecruteak City
Silver's Trial
As you approach the Dance Theater,
Silver
is just leaving, still agonizing over his defeat by the
Kimono Girls
. He warns you not to get complacent just because you defeated
Team Rocket
, as the Kimono Girls are powerful Trainers. He leaves quickly so that he does not have to see you win where he could not.
Dance Theater
Once inside, you proceed to the stage, where you are welcomed by Zuki. She explains that in order to persuade
Ho-Oh
HG
/
Lugia
SS
to return, they needed to find a person who has the right bond with Pokémon. She reveals that it was they who gave the
Mystery Egg
to
Mr. Pokémon
, and asked that he give it to someone who showed "true potential". However, pure intentions alone will not be enough to face the Legendary Pokémon's power. Zuki then gives you a chance to prove yourself by defeating each of the sisters in quick succession.
VS Zuki
Zuki, the girl from
Violet City
, intends to test how closely you have bonded with your Pokémon.

3F
Beginning on the third floor, the tower features a series of ramps to confound any intruders looking to use the Legendary Pokémon for nefarious deeds. Pick up the

6F
The sixth floor serves as a transition between the tightly-packed ramps on the lower floors and the far-flung
warp tiles
above. Collect the
Max Potion
next to the pillar, then move counter-clockwise along the path to find a
Full Heal
in the northwest corner. Head southward over the two ramps to reach the western stairs.
7F
Step on the northern warp tile to reach the central area, then take the next one to reach the eastern part of 9F. There are two warp tiles to the south. Take the one on the right first; this leads to the dead-end central part of 8F and a
Max Elixir
. The one on the left leads to the dead-end southeastern part of 8F and a
Nugget
. Backtrack to the northern warp tile on 7F, then pick up the
Max Revive
in the northeast corner. Head south and take the southern warp tile to the west side of 8F.

Ho-Oh Descends to the Bell Tower
Zuki and the other
Kimono Girls
are waiting here for you. She explains that the dance that they have long practiced and the chime of the
Clear Bell
are parts of a ritual to summon
Ho-Oh
from the great arch of the sky once again. The Clear Bell then floats up into the air above you and the girls take their positions around the tower's spire. The Clear Bell and the four bells attached to the tower begin to chime, and the girls begin to dance as a flurry of sunset-colored leaves blows through the area. The sound reaches into the sky, and Ho-Oh descends to the rooftop a moment later. Zuki says that your heart and the Clear Bell in harmony have caused it to appear, and that it must have been waiting for someone like you all this time.
VS Ho-Oh
The rainbow-colored
Ho-Oh
has returned to its perch! Begin with
Water
- and
Electric-type
attacks to wear its health down quickly, then follow up with
Fighting
-,
Fire
-,
Steel
-,
Grass
-, and
Bug-type
moves to chip away at it even further. Consider inflicting status ailments like
Sleep
and
Paralysis
to restrict its movements, and be sure to bring along some healing items as well.

Whirl Islands
The
Whirl Islands
are connected underwater by a sprawling network of dark caves, where seawater and boulders restrict movement in certain areas. Despite being first seen on the initial visit to
Route 41
, it was impossible to fully explore the area without the field moves
Surf
,
Strength
, and
Whirlpool
, and difficult to do so without
Flash
, as well. Visitors may enter from any of the four islands, but those looking for
the immense, silver-colored Pokémon
should enter from the northeast island. Possessing the
Silver Wing
and the
Tidal Bell
prove your worth as a Trainer, and together grant access to a secluded chamber deep below sea level.
HeartGold players cannot encounter Lugia without the Silver Wing. The Tidal Bell is unobtainable for them, and not required.

There is no shortcut leading out of the cave, so using an Escape Rope is the fastest way to reach the exit.
Via the Southeast Island
Entering from the southeast island ultimately leads to the southwest island's entrance. The only items accessible from this direction are a Calcium and a Ultra Ball, both of which will have been already obtained by this point.
