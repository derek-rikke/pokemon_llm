Cianwood City
Cianwood City
Cianwood City
is a small, seaside town on a separate landmass to the southwest of mainland
Johto
. Despite its distance, many Trainers still brave the waters of Routes
40
and
41
to challenge the
Cianwood Gym
, or to visit
a centuries-old pharmacy
known for its unique medicine.
Cliff Edge Gate
leads west to Routes
47
and
48
, but the
Johto Safari Zone
at the end is still under construction.

Then There was One
The house in the southwest part of town belongs to a PokéManiac. Speak to him to learn that he was bullied by someone with "
piercing eyes and long hair
" into giving up one of his Pokémon. He still has one left, but is afraid of what will happen if the thief returns. He asks that you take his remaining Pokémon, a
Shuckle
, for safekeeping.
He will eventually ask for his Shuckle back, but will decide to let you keep it if it has grown
friendly
enough toward you.
Cianwood Gym
Cianwood Gym
Cianwood City Pokémon Gym
Leader: Chuck
His Roaring Fists Do The Talking
The
Cianwood Gym
specializes in
Fighting-type
Pokémon. Fighting-type moves are super effective against
Dark
-,
Ice
-,
Normal
-,
Rock
-, and
Steel-type
Pokémon, while Fighting-type Pokémon are weak to
Flying
- and
Psychic-type
moves.
The Gym is designed to mimic a cliffside, with an artificial waterfall under which the
Gym Leader
can be seen meditating. First, climb up the west side to battle Black Belt Yoshi and Black Belt Nob. When Nob approaches you, he blocks off the stairway to the uppermost level from this direction. On the east side, battle Black Belt Lao, then cross over the bridge to reach a red button on the west side's uppermost level. Pressing this button turns the winch and raises the pipe, stopping the flow of water.
Chuck
's
Primeape
has a high
Attack
stat, allowing it to deal considerable damage already. Using
Leer
cuts the foe's
Defense
, and
Rock Slide
lets it fight back against
Flying-type
Pokémon. His
Poliwrath
can lull the target to
sleep
with
Hypnosis
, and
Body Slam
may cause
paralysis
. As a
Water
Pokémon, it is also vulnerable to
Grass
- and
Electric-type
moves. Both Pokémon have access to
Focus Punch
, the strongest Fighting-type move and one that forces the user to first spend a turn readying its attack. If the user is hit before it can strike, the move fails. Healing items like
Awakening
and
Chesto Berry
will be helpful, as will using moves like
Reflect
to boost your Pokémon's
Defense
.

After the battle,
Chuck
awards you the
Storm Badge
, which ensures obedience of all Pokémon up to level 70 and enables the use of
Fly
in the field. He also gives you
TM01
(
Focus Punch
) as a prize.
Fly Like a Bird
Upon leaving the Gym,
Chuck's wife
immediately notices your new
Storm Badge
, and gives you
HM02
(
Fly
). This field move allows a Trainer to quickly return to any familiar location. She comments how it is a good thing that her husband was defeated, as it gives him a reason to train.
Cameron's house
The northeast house belongs to the
Cameron
, the Photographer. He is not home, but a relative of his invites you to use the camera set up outside to take pictures with your party Pokémon.
Chasing the Wind
The far north end of the beach holds a small hill at the foot of the cliffs. It is here that you have your first sighting of the legendary
Suicune
since it fled from the
Burned Tower
. When you get too close, it races around you before running out over the waves.
Eusine
appears a moment later, and challenges you to a battle in order to prove himself to the legendary beast.
VS Eusine
Eusine
has a diverse team of Pokémon, but there is still some overlap in weaknesses. His
Drowzee
can lull the target to sleep with
Hypnosis
before stealing its health with
Dream Eater
.
Haunter
's
Mean Look
prevents escape while
Curse
cuts its health in order to afflict the target. Both of these Pokémon are vulnerable to
Ghost
- and
Dark-type
attacks. As an
Electric-type
Pokémon, his
Electrode
takes serious damage only from
Ground-type
moves.

Olivine City
Olivine Lighthouse
6F
Return to the
Olivine Lighthouse
and take the elevator to the top floor to deliver the
SecretPotion
to
Jasmine
. She administers the medicine to
Amphy
, and its vitality and light is restored. Seeing it returned to full health, Jasmine promises to return to the
Olivine Gym
.
Grand Opening!
Upon leaving the lighthouse, you receive a call from Warden
Baoba
. He informs you that the
Safari Zone
is finally open, and that it can be reached by traveling through
Cianwood City
's
Cliff Edge Gate
.
Olivine Gym
Olivine Gym
Olivine City Pokémon Gym
Leader: Jasmine
The Steel-Clad Defense Girl
The
Olivine Gym
specializes in
Steel-type
Pokémon. Steel-type moves are super effective against
Ice
- and
Rock-type
Pokémon, while Steel-type Pokémon are weak to
Fighting
-,
Fire
-, and
Ground-type
moves.
The Gym features neither puzzles to solve nor Gym Trainers to defeat, allowing challengers to reach the
Gym Leader
immediately.
Both of
Jasmine
's two
Magnemite
can harass their target with
Supersonic
and
Thunder Wave
, though
Ground-type
Pokémon are immune to the latter. Her
Steelix
is vulnerable to
Fire
attacks as well, but can retaliate with
Rock Throw
against unsuspecting Fire Pokémon.
Screech
lowers the target's
Defense
, while
Iron Tail
may do the same. Its low
Special Defense
leaves it particularly vulnerable to
special
Fire- and
Water-type
attacks.

Having now explored western
Johto
, the next destination is the region's mountainous northeast area. Fly back to
Ecruteak City
and head east to reach
Route 42
.
Route 42
Route 42
Route 42
connects
Ecruteak City
to
Mahogany Town
in the east. The path runs along the base of
Mt. Mortar
, and is divided twice over by small lakes. Crossing these waters directly requires the use of
Surf
, but it is possible to detour through the mountain to avoid them. A grove of
Apricorn
trees grows in the middle of the route.

The Hasty Hiker
Just as you approach the western entrance to

, a Hiker comes running out of the cave. He apologizes for bumping into you, and gives you
HM04
(
Strength
) to make up for it. This field move lets a compatible Pokémon move large boulders with ease.
Chasing the Wind
A grove of
Apricorn
trees grows between the two lakes, blocked by an
overgrown tree
. Enter this grove to find
Suicune
again, standing among the trees. It flees again when you get too close, dashing off eastward toward
Mahogany Town
.
Eusine
arrives a moment later, and mentions how you always seem to be around when Suicune appears. He is not worried though, as he believes his desire to search for the Pokémon surpasses your own. He reaffirms his commitment to find out what Suicune is looking for, and hurries off after it.
Mt. Mortar, Entrance
Mt. Mortar, Lower Cave
Mt. Mortar
Mt. Mortar
is a sprawling cave set deep into the northern mountains. It is an optional cave to enter, but contains many valuable items and Pokémon. Navigating the difficult terrain requires the use of
Surf

Strength
,
Flash
, and
Waterfall
. As such, it is not possible to reach every area on the first visit.
