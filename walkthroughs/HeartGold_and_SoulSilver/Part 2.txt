City Tour
An elderly man known by his nickname, Guide Gent, can be found on the east side of town. When you attempt to pass by, he stops you. Recognizing you as a rookie Trainer, he offers to explain a few things. He rushes ahead with
a tour
, but hurries back when he realizes that you are not wearing any
Running Shoes
. He points out the
Pokémon Center
, the
Poké Mart
, the path to
Route 30
, and the sea, before ending the tour outside his home. To reward you for keeping up with him, he gives you a pair of Running Shoes.
The Sprint button now appears on the Touch Screen.
He relays the instructions: by toggling the Sprint Button on the Touch Screen, or by holding the B Button, a pair of Running Shoes allows the wearer to move at twice the speed of walking.
Pokémon Center
The first building you will see is the
Pokémon Center
. This Pokémon hospital will heal your team to full health and eliminate any status ailments they may have. Each facility also has a PC for Trainers to use, where they can access their Pokémon storage,
Mailbox
, and use
Seals
to decorate their Poké Balls. As Trainers may only carry six Pokémon with them at once, any others are immediately transferred to storage upon capture. It is a good idea to heal up and save your progress whenever you find a Pokémon Center.
Poké Mart
Another shop sits to the west of the Pokémon Center. This is the local
Poké Mart
; these stores offer a variety of Poké Balls, Potions, and other items. It is helpful to stock up on supplies whenever possible, as there is no telling what you may run into on your journey.

One More Thing
When you approach the north exit to
Route 30
, you are stopped by Guide Gent. He forgot to give you something, and hands you a
Map Card
to add to your
Pokégear
. This expansion card acts as a
Town Map
, allowing you to view the entire region. It even displays your current location!
Route 30
Route 30
Running north from
Cherrygrove City
,
Route 30
is a grassy path where many novice Trainers like to battle. The road diverges as it moves northward; the eastern branch leads to a clearing with
Mr. Pokémon
's house, while the western branch leads uphill to
Route 31
. A battle between Pokémon Trainers initially blocks the western path.

Southern house
Visit the southernmost house and speak to the man inside. He says that most people that stop by are actually looking for
Mr. Pokémon
's house, instead. He asks if you have any Apricorns, and explains a bit about them. Realizing that you have nothing to keep them in, he gives you an
Apricorn Box
. This box allows you to pick and store Apricorns, with enough room for 99 of each of the seven varieties.
Mr. Pokémon's house
Visit the house in the northeast clearing to meet
Mr. Pokémon
. He recognizes you right away as an associate of
Professor Elm
, and gives you the
Mystery Egg
. He says that he obtained the Egg from a friend of his from
Ecruteak City
. Elm is the authority on Pokémon
evolution
, which is why he contacted him about the Egg, and even Mr. Pokémon's guest agrees. Mr. Pokémon heals your Pokémon before the man introduces himself as
Professor Oak
, and notices that Elm entrusted you with your
first partner Pokémon
. Seeing that you are dependable, Oak decides to give you a
Pokédex
.
The Pokédex button now appears on the Touch Screen.
This handheld device is a high-tech encyclopedia that records data on every Pokémon you encounter, and will be complete when you catch a member of every species. Oak exchanges phone numbers with you, then leaves for his radio show in
Goldenrod City
.
A Terrible Tale
When you step back outside,
Professor Elm
calls in a state of panic. He is too upset to describe what has happened, so hurry back to
New Bark Town
to investigate!
Cherrygrove City
Ambush!
When you reach the east side of
Cherrygrove City
,
the young, red-haired man
that was spying on
Elm
's Lab ambushes you. He knows that you received a Pokémon from the Lab, and calls it a waste for a wimp like you to have one of Elm's rare Pokémon. It turns out that he also has a Pokémon, and draws you into battle.
Rival Battle 1
When battling, each Trainer sends out one Pokémon at a time; both of these particular Pokémon are on
Level
5, indicated by the
Lv5
aside each Pokémon. Below that is the health bar, which shows the Pokémon's remaining
HP
. A battle is won or lost when either side has no remaining Pokémon with the strength to continue.
Choosing
Fight
will allow you to launch an attack against the target. Both combatants have two moves. The first will damage the opponent, and the other will lower one of its stats. If your Pokémon's HP runs low, be sure to use a Potion. Go to
Bag
to select the medicine and apply it to the Pokémon.

Once you have defeated
him
, you earn a cash reward of
$
500 and your Pokémon earns valuable
Experience Points
. He leaves, but returns a moment later to retrieve the
Trainer Card
that he dropped and is annoyed to find that you saw his name on it. He leaves a second time, leaving you free to continue on to Elm's Lab.
New Bark Town
Professor Elm's Lab
Back in
New Bark Town
, you return to the laboratory to find a police officer questioning the professor. One of his
rare Pokémon
was stolen by
a young man with long, red hair
! The officer believes that the culprit will always return to the scene of the crime, and assumes you to be the guilty party before
Lyra
/
Ethan
intervenes. She/He points out the red-haired boy as the true thief, and upon hearing that you battled a Trainer matching this description, the officer asks if you happened to catch his name. As with the
player character
, the
rival
's name may be up to seven characters long. Once the officer and your friend leave,
Professor Elm
asks about
Mr. Pokémon
's discovery. He accepts the
Mystery Egg
and intends to keep it for a while in order to study it. He is pleased to hear that
Professor Oak
gave you a
Pokédex
. He suggests taking the
Pokémon Gym
challenge, with the nearest one being located in
Violet City
. The road to becoming a
Pokémon Champion
will be a long one, so he advises you to stop at home before setting off.

Safeguard Your Savings
Speak to
Mom
, who is excited to see your new Pokémon. Realizing that you are headed off on an adventure, she offers to save your money for you. If all of your Pokémon faint during battle, you will
black out
and lose some of your money, but anything left with Mom is safe. If you accept her offer, 25% of the prize money won from each battle will automatically be sent to her. Money can be deposited with or withdrawn from her at any time. For every
$
10,000 of savings on-hand, she will occasionally call to say that she has bought
an item or a bundle of five Berries
, then apologizes for spending the money she is saving. There is no limit to the number of Berries that may be obtained, but other items can only be obtained once.
Route 29
How to Catch a Pokémon
When you return to
Route 29
,
Lyra
/
Ethan
is waiting for you. She/He and Marill lead you into the
tall grass
, where they demonstrate how to catch a wild Pokémon by lowering the target's
HP
before throwing a Poké Ball. She/He also mentions how inflicting status ailments like
Sleep
and
Paralysis
help to increase the odds of a successful capture. With the demonstration complete, she/he hands you five
Poké Balls
to start you on your journey. From this point on, you are able to purchase them for yourself in most
Poké Marts
.
By this point, the Trainer battle that blocked
Route 30
's western branch has ended. Continue north from
Cherrygrove City
to reach
Route 31
.
