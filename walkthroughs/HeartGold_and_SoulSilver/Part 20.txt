Route 7
Route 7
is a tiny road between
Saffron City
and
Celadon City
. The
Underground Path
links to
Route 8
, but has been closed indefinitely due to excessive battling in the tunnel. This is the only area where two new
Dark-type
Pokémon—
Murkrow
and
Houndour
—can be found, but only in the overnight hours.

Celadon Condominiums
Take the front entrance and the left elevator for access to
Game Freak
on the third floor. You'll encounter
Lyra
and her Marill and she briefly talks to you about the
GB Sounds
, which can be obtained from the Sound Designer at the end of the room once the player has all 16 Gym Badges. The roof can also be accessed from this elevator but there's nothing to do here.
When night falls, take the path behind the Pokémon Center and enter the Celadon Condominiums through the back door. The man on the roof will tell a scary story, and rewards you with a
Spell Tag
for listening to the whole thing. When held, this item increases the power of
Ghost-type
moves by 20%.
Restaurant
The restaurant on the south side of town is currently hosting an eat-a-thon. It is impossible to participate, as the contest is already in progress. However, you can meet a notable figure from a foreign region. The girl with pink hair is
Maylene
, Gym Leader of
Sinnoh
's
Veilstone City
.
Game Corner
Like
its counterpart
, Celadon's
Game Corner
has also added the new
Voltorb Flip
game.

Celadon Gym
Celadon City Pokémon Gym
Leader: Erika
The Nature-Loving Princess!
The
Celadon Gym
specializes in
Grass-type
Pokémon.
Fire
,
Flying
, and
Ice
attacks will work wonders, but
Water
-,
Ground
-, and
Rock-type
Pokémon should sit this one out.
Erika
's
Tangela
is especially vulnerable to
special moves
, so take it out with a Fire or Ice attack. Her
Jumpluff
can be a speedy nuisance, but with a 4× weakness to Ice moves, a sub-zero shot will ground it for good. If
Sunny Day
takes effect,
Synthesis
will restore ⅔ of the user's maximum HP,
Bellossom
's
SolarBeam
can launch without a charge-up, and the
Speed
of each of
Erika
's Pokémon is doubled due to their shared
Chlorophyll
Ability. In addition, Fire moves receive a 50% power boost.
