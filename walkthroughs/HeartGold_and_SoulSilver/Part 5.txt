Azalea Town
Azalea Town
Azalea
is a small, isolated town on the south end of
Johto
's peninsula. Due to its remote location between
Union Cave
and
Ilex Forest
, the town sees few visitors aside from those looking to challenge the
Azalea Gym
. A Poké Ball craftsman named
Kurt
lives in the northwest part of town. The
Slowpoke Well
is located in the east, and its resident
Slowpoke
freely wander around town.

The Man in Black
When you approach the
Slowpoke Well
on the east side of town, you see a man dressed in black harassing one of the residents. He identifies himself as a member of
Team Rocket
. After admitting that the group had disbanded once before, he claims that it has been revived in order to pursue
Giovanni
's goals. He shoves the man, who hurries back into town, before moving into position to block off the well. If spoken to, he says that the well is unsafe and he is simply guarding it so that no one hurts themselves.
Charcoal Kiln
The house in the southeast part of town houses a charcoal kiln. The owner uses a
Farfetch'd
to fell trees in
Ilex Forest
and obtain the necessary materials. The wood is then treated and turned into
Charcoal
, which is then supplied to the local Poké Mart for sale.
Save the Slowpoke!
Visit the northwest house and speak to
Kurt
. If you were looking to have some custom Poké Balls made, it will have to wait. He informs you that members of a criminal organization known as
Team Rocket
have been sighted in
Slowpoke Well
, even though the group was supposedly disbanded
three years ago
. The rumor around town is that they have been cutting off
SlowpokeTails
to sell! Kurt was just about to confront them when you stopped by, and rushes off to save the Pokémon.

Slowpoke Well, B2F
Slowpoke Well
The
Slowpoke Well
is located on the east side of town, near
Route 33
. The cave is home to the town's
Slowpoke
, which are kept as pets. Legend has it that around 400 years ago, one of the Slowpoke from the well yawned, and in doing so ended a persistent drought that plagued
Azalea Town
.

Kurt
can be found just inside the well. The
Team Rocket Grunt
that was blocking the entrance was so startled when Kurt shouted at him that he fell down the well. Kurt tried to give chase but lost his footing as well, landing hard on his back. He cannot move for the moment, so you need to save the
Slowpoke
in his place.
B1F
Go north to find and defeat that first Grunt. Climb onto the northeast ridge to pick up a
Super Potion
and battle a female Grunt. Walk down the stairway and go west to fight a third Grunt. Head north past a couple of captive Slowpoke to battle an
Executive
, the one in charge of the operation. Speak to him, and he claims to often be considered the scariest and cruelest guy in
Team Rocket
. He urges you not to interfere in their business, and draws you into battle.

Defeated,
Proton
admits that
Team Rocket
continued its activities in secret after the order to disband three years ago. He expresses little worry about you interfering in the group's work, but advises you to be very afraid of what they have planned. The Grunts flee, and
Kurt
is on his feet again. After checking on the two
Slowpoke
, he takes you back to his home.
Kurt, the Craftsman
Kurt
commends you for saving the town's
Slowpoke
. As he mentioned before, he explains that
Team Rocket
was broken up three years ago by a boy named
Red
. Knowing that the group is active again leaves him with a bad feeling. He tries to set his worries aside for the moment, and offers to make custom Poké Balls for you anytime. He only has one spare Poké Ball right now, and gives you a
Fast Ball
as thanks for saving the
Slowpoke
. If you have collected any
Apricorns
by this point, Kurt will immediately notice and offer to turn them into Poké Balls.
The
Apricorn Box
screen opens automatically, allowing you to choose an
Apricorn
variety to give to Kurt. He only accepts one variety at a time, but has no restriction on quantity. Any Apricorn(s) given to him will be processed into the resulting Poké Ball(s) by the next day.
Afterward, his granddaughter gives you his phone number.
There are seven varieties of Apricorn, each suited for a different type of Poké Ball.

Azalea Gym
Azalea Gym
Azalea Town Pokémon Gym
Leader: Bugsy
The Walking Bug Pokémon Encyclopedia
The
Azalea Gym
specializes in
Bug-type
Pokémon. Bug-type moves are super effective against
Dark
-,
Grass
-, and
Psychic-type
Pokémon, while Bug-type Pokémon are weak to
Fire
-,
Flying
-, and
Rock-type
moves.
The Gym features two large gaps in the floor, with a series of rails that mimic the appearance of spiderwebs crossing over them. In order to cross these gaps, challengers must board
Spinarak
-themed karts to ride along the rails. The kart will always make the first possible turn, but challengers can flip several switches to engage or disengage sections of rail to alter the kart's path. Step on the left-most kart to reach the center area and battle Bug Catcher Benny. Ride the next kart over the second gap to battle Twins Amy & Mimi in the northwest part of the building. Flip the blue switch nearby to disengage the blue rail, allowing the kart to reach the west-central area. Flip the red switch to disengage the red rail and ride the kart one last time to reach the
Gym Leader
.
Bugsy
leads with
Scyther
, his strongest Pokémon due to its high
Attack
and
Speed
.
U-turn
is a strong
Bug-type
attack that deals serious damage to
Grass-type
Pokémon like
Chikorita
. Neither of Bugsy's other two Pokémon are much of a threat, though
Kakuna
may
poison
its target with
Poison Sting
. Bug Pokémon can do little against the high Defense of
Rock-type
Pokémon; if you traded for the boy's
Onix
in
Violet City
, counterattack with
Rock Throw
for an easy victory.

After the battle,
Bugsy
awards you the
Hive Badge
, which ensures obedience of all Pokémon up to level 30 and enables the use of
Cut
in the field. He also gives you
TM89
(
U-turn
) as a prize.
Ambush!
When you reach the west side of town,
Silver
catches up to you. He asks if it is true that
Team Rocket
has returned, and accuses you of lying after learning that you defeated them. He draws you into battle to force you to prove yourself.
Rival Battle 2
Silver
has added two more Pokémon to his team since the previous battle.
Gastly
takes serious damage from
Ghost
-,
Psychic
-, and
Dark-type
attacks, but its defenses are low enough that attacks of nearly any type will be effective. Ghost Pokémon are immune to
Normal-type
moves, so moves like
Tackle
and
Scratch
are useless.
Zubat
is vulnerable to
Rock
- and
Electric-type
moves, among others. Use the
Onix
from
Violet City
, or a
Mareep
from
Route 32
, for an easy knockout. The Pokémon that he took from
Elm
's lab has evolved since then and learned a move that matches its type, which boosts its power with a
same-type attack bonus
. Avoid pitting your own
first partner Pokémon
against it or risk taking serious damage.

Afterward, he declares his hatred for anything weak, be it human or Pokémon. Silver vows to get stronger and wipe out the weak, including
Team Rocket
. He warns you to stay out of his way before leaving for
Ilex Forest
.
Ilex Forest
Ilex Forest
Ilex Forest
is a densely wooded area between
Azalea Town
and
Route 34
. Trees grow so close together that most sunlight never reaches the forest floor, leaving the area in what seems like perpetual night. A
shrine
dedicated to
the forest's protector
is located a short distance from the southern entrance.

Flight of the Farfetch'd
The apprentice from
Azalea
's Charcoal Kiln can be found a short distance from the southern entrance, and stops you when you approach. He tells you that the two
Farfetch'd
that cut down trees to be turned into
Charcoal
have wandered deeper into the forest. He explains that Farfetch'd have sensitive ears, and will turn toward the sound if you step on a branch. He is too scared of the dark forest to move, so it is up to you to find them. Farfetch'd are startled easily, and approaching them from the wrong direction will only chase them deeper into the forest.
The first duck is located a short distance to the east, at the southwest corner of a large grove of trees. Step on the pile of branches to the south of the Pokémon to draw its attention, then circle around the trees to approach it from behind.
The second duck is located in the southeast part of the forest, at the northwest corner of the second grove. Take the easternmost path and step on either pile of branches to the east of Farfetch'd to draw its attention. Circle around and approach it from the south to chase it to the grove with three trees. Loop back around and step on the easternmost pile of branches. Circle around the three-tree grove to approach it from behind.
The boy thanks you for your help, explaining that neither
Farfetch'd
will listen to him as he has no
Badges
. His boss arrives a moment later. Seeing his two Pokémon, Far and Fetch'd, returned safely, he rewards you with
HM01
(
Cut
) as thanks for saving his business. Teach this field move to a compatible Pokémon and use it to remove the small tree nearby, clearing a path forward. If you return to the Charcoal Kiln, the apprentice will reward you with a piece of
Charcoal
.
Shake, Rattle, and Roll
Southeast of the pond, there is a man standing atop a ledge, facing one of the trees. When you approach, you witness him aggresively attack the tree. Speak to him, and he explains that he has been shaking trees with
Headbutt
, and invites you to try it as well before offering to
teach the move
to one of your Pokémon. This field move allows Trainers to shake
this type of tree
, which sometimes causes a wild Pokémon to fall out. Depending on the time of day, the Pokémon that appears may be
asleep
. There are
several
Pokémon
species
that can only be encountered this way.
The Mysterious Girl
When you approach the northern ledge, you find the same
mysterious kimono-clad girl
, apparently lost in the dark forest. She says that you must be imagining things if you recognize her from
Violet City
, and asks if you will show her the way out of the forest. She questions if you really know the direction to the exit, so your partner Pokémon moves a short distance westward to show the way. She compliments the Pokémon before continuing onward.

Meet the Grandparents
When you approach the
Pokémon Day Care
building,
Lyra
/
Ethan
and Marill are just arriving. She/He visits with their grandfather and thanks the elderly man for raising one of their Pokémon, and then notices your presence. She/He introduces you to the man before leading you inside the building, where you are introduced to their grandmother. As she/he turns to leave, your friend gives you their phone number.
Pokémon Day Care
The
Pokémon Day Care
allows Trainers to leave up to two of their Pokémon to be raised by the couple. Any Pokémon left in their care earns one
experience point
for every step you take. It costs a flat rate of
$
100, plus another
$
100 for every level gained, to withdraw a Pokémon.
If a
compatible
male and female are left here at the same time, you may return to discover that the elderly couple has found an
Egg
. Keep the Egg in your party, like with the
Mystery Egg
, and it will eventually hatch. The Pokémon that appears will be the lowest species in the evolutionary line of the mother. If either parent is unavailable,
Ditto
may be used as a substitute; in this case, the newly-hatched Pokémon will be the lowest species in the evolutionary line of the non-Ditto parent. This is the only way to obtain additional members of a certain species, like
Eevee
, and
baby Pokémon
, like
Pichu
.
When you leave the building, the old man gives you the phone numbers for both him and his wife, so that you can call to check up on any Pokémon that they might be raising for you.
