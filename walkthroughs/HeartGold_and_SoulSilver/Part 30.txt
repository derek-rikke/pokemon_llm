The Three Stones
Make a return trip to

and visit the

building. Talk to
Steven
near the front desk, and he asks you a question:
Of a group of stones in front of you, would you choose the green stone, the red stone, or the blue stone?
The answer you give determines which Pokémon he offers you.
Treecko
,
Torchic
, and
Mudkip
are the starter Pokémon of his native
Hoenn
region.

Follow the Leader
Once Steven leaves, follow him to the
Pewter Museum
. Enter the building to find him viewing one of the exhibits while muttering about the stars in the night sky. When he leaves, follow him back to the
Silph Co.
building.
Time for a Trade
Speak to him and he asks to trade Pokémon. He is looking for a
Forretress
, and is willing to part with his
Beldum
. Beldum can only be found in the
Safari Zone
, while Forretress are unavailable in the wild and must be evolved from a
Pineco
. Beldum will eventually evolve into the powerful
Metagross
, and Steven has given this one a
Dawn Stone
to hold.
Lugia Emerges from the Waterfall Basin
HG
As the player should have received the
Silver Wing
in Pewter City, proceed to the
Whirl Islands
to capture
Lugia
. Lugia will not let itself be caught easily, so be sure to stock up on your favorite type of Poké Ball. Repels, Escape Ropes, and Pokémon with status-inflicting moves, like Spore or Thunder Wave, are also recommended. Fly back to
Olivine
or
Cianwood
and sail out into the ocean.
Surf
and
Whirlpool
are required to fully explore the islands' underwater cave network;
Strength
and
Flash
are helpful, but not necessary.
Whirl Islands
There are many items to be found throughout the caves, but if you are only looking for Lugia, start with the northeast island.

Step inside the cave, and take the ladder to the floor below.
Walk down the stairway to reach a hidden
Pearl
to the northeast, and a
Full Restore
to the south. Jump the ledge and climb the stairway to the east in order to reach a
Nugget
and a hidden
Super Repel
. Head east and jump the two ledges to reach a ladder; this leads to a dead-end with an
Ultra Ball
. Go south, jump another ledge, and backtrack to the first ladder in the northwest corner. Head south along the upper level to reach a
Carbos
, and climb down the ladder to the southeast.
Grab the
Max Elixir
and
Full Restore
from this dead-end area, then use an Escape Rope to exit the cave.
Northeast Island
Walk east, jump the ledge, and take the northern path to reach the next part of the main cavern.
Follow the rock platform southward, collect the hidden
Revive
, and climb down the ladder to B2F.
Inspect the north wall for a hidden
Full Restore
, then grab the
Max Revive
to the west. Speak with the monk, and the
Silver Wing
suddenly floats up into the air. When he sees the shimmering silver feather, the monk allows you to pass. Step through the archway just south of him to reach a
Rare Candy
. Continue the climb down the cliffside to reach another archway, where your lead Pokémon retreats into its Poké Ball.
Step inside the waterfall chamber and find Lugia waiting in front of the waterfall. Make sure you save before battling if you are trying to capture, in case Lugia faints.
Lugia
Start off by using status-inflicting moves, like
Spore
or
Thunder Wave
, to wear it down. Follow up with
Rock
-,
Ghost
-,
Electric
-,
Ice
-, or
Dark-type
attacks to inflict double the damage. Then slowly chip away at its remaining health with
Fighting
-,
Grass
-, or
Psychic-type
attacks, as moves of these types inflict only half- or quarter-damage. If you happen to knock it out, it will reappear if you again beat the Elite Four.

Southeast Island
Check the northwest corner for a hidden
Rare Candy
, then take the ladder down to the main cavern.
Head north along the rock ledge to find a
Calcium
. Go down the stairway and loop around to the west. Search near the south-central ladder for a hidden
Ultra Ball
, then move the nearby boulder northward. Head west to reach an
Escape Rope
, then climb the southwest ladder.
Detour across the pool of water to the east to collect another
Ultra Ball
, then take the exit to emerge on the southwest island.
Southwest Island
The only items accessible from the southwest island are the Escape Rope and the Calcium, both of which would have been collected already.
Ho-Oh Descends to the Bell Tower
SS
As the player should have received the
Rainbow Wing
in Pewter City, proceed to the
Bell Tower
in
Ecruteak City
to capture
Ho-Oh
. Ho-Oh will not let itself be caught easily, so be sure to stock up on your favorite type of Poké Ball. Repels, Escape Ropes, and Pokémon with status-inflicting moves, like Spore or Thunder Wave, are also recommended. Head north from the Dance Theater to reach the Barrier Station. Flash the Fog Badge to reach Bellchime Trail. On the trail, speak to
Morty
. He will tell you that Ho-Oh did not choose him and asks if you would help him in his training. Add his phone number if you wish to battle him again. Then proceed to the Bell Tower.
Bell Tower
As you approach the back of the first floor, the
Rainbow Wing
suddenly floats up into the air. Seeing the shimmering rainbow feather, the monk finally moves from the ladder.

5F
Work your way to the pillar for a
Rare Candy
. The ramps here keep you from advancing, so take the southeast stairs and backtrack through 4F. Stay to the west of the pillar to reach the stairs in the south.
6F
6F has a simple layout that serves as a transition between the ramps on the lower floors and what lies above. The next three floors use a series of warp tiles for quick navigation. First grab the
Max Potion
, then circle around to the northwest corner to get the
Full Heal
. Take the stairs up to 7F.
Bell Tower, 7F
Bell Tower, 8F
7F
Step on the nearest warp tile to reach the pillar, and take the next to reach the east wall of 9F. There are two warp tiles to the south; the right one leads to the center of 8F and a
Max Elixir
, while the left one leads to the south side of 8F and a
Nugget
. Backtrack to the first warp on 7F, grab the
Max Revive
to the northeast, and go south to take the next warp to the west side of 8F.
8F
The next warp takes you to the north side of 9F where you can find an
HP Up
, and the next warp tile on 9F brings you back to the east side of 8F. Pick up the
Full Restore
to the northwest and take one last warp to the center of 9F.
Bell Tower, 9F
Bell Tower, Rooftop
9F
Climb the stairs to reach the rooftop.
Rooftop
Climb the golden stairway to reach the tower's rooftop, where
Ho-Oh
will be waiting for you. Make sure you save before battling if you are trying to capture, in case Ho-Oh faints.
Ho-Oh
Start off by using status-inflicting moves, like
Spore
or
Thunder Wave
, to wear it down. Follow up with
Water
- or
Electric-type
attacks to inflict double the damage. Use caution with
Rock-type
attacks, as Ho-Oh takes four times the normal damage from such moves. Then slowly chip away at its remaining health with
Fire
-,
Grass
-,
Fighting
-,
Bug
-, or
Steel-type
attacks, as moves of these types only inflict half- or quarter-damage. If you happen to knock it out, it will reappear if you again beat the Elite Four.

Embedded Tower, as seen when occupied by Groudon
Near the entrance to the ruins, a Hiker informs you of their history. Ages ago, the
Embedded Tower
was constructed deep into the cliffside, and its peak was said to touch the sky. It is believed that it also ran far below to the ocean floor, as well. In short, the ruins formed a link between
the land
,
the sea
, and
the sky
. Enter the chamber to find the legendary Pokémon

Oak's Lab
Add the ancient Pokémon to your party and pay a visit to
Professor Oak
. He is amazed that you have caught one of these powerful Pokémon, but he always thinks of
Kyogre
and
Groudon
as a pair; wherever one appears, the other must not be far away. Since you have one already, he wonders if you could bring both to him. However, Groudon only shows itself to those with shining-silver spirits, while Kyogre only appears to those with golden hearts. Find a Trainer that matches this description and trade for the second Pokémon. When you show the pair to the professor, he rewards you with the
Jade Orb
, which calls the third member of the Hoenn myth to the
Embedded Tower
.

Rayquaza
As
Rayquaza
is related to the other two super-ancient Pokémon, its Ability is also involves the weather; however,
Air Lock
eliminates the effects of all weather conditions. Its
Outrage
attack is powerful enough already, but can become even more destructive if
AncientPower
is able to raise its stats. Begin with
Rock
- and
Dragon-type
attacks to wear it down quickly.
Ice-type
attacks are extremely effective, as well. After that, switch to
Grass
,
Fire

Water
,
Bug
