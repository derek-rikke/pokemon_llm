Pewter Museum of Science
The Museum's interior
The
Pewter Museum
has several unique exhibits on display, though most are on loan to other museums, so admission is currently free. The scientist in the smaller room has been studying
fossil
revitalization, and can resurrect ancient Pokémon from these treasures.
Certain fossil varieties
can be found in the
Ruins of Alph
, while
other relics
can be found in the newly excavated
Cliff Cave

Pokémon.
Grass-type
attacks—like the
Giga Drain
TM move from Celadon Gym—will inflict heavy damage against all seven Pokémon in the building. In addition,
Brock

Graveler

Rhyhorn

Onix
are weak against

moves, while his
