Trainer House, 1F
Trainer House
The
Trainer House
allows challengers to battle a certain opponent under controlled conditions. The default opponent is
Cal
, who uses the final forms of the Johto starter Pokémon. However, by connecting the
Pokéwalker
to that of another player and re-syncing it back to your game, the opponent will be that Trainer instead, with the same Pokémon, moves, and items. Trainers battled this way have their Pokémon's levels capped at 50. Rather than experience or money, victorious Trainers earn
Battle Points
which may be redeemed in the
Battle Frontier
near
Olivine City
.

Red's House
Red
is not home right now. He defeated
Blue
to earn his Champion title, but gave up that position with the
Pokémon League
to continue his training. His mother is proud of him, but still worried that he is alone somewhere.
Blue's House
Blue
is away too, but his sister
Daisy
will offer to
groom
one of your Pokémon every day, from 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Grooming is an important process for obtaining Pokémon like
Espeon
and
Umbreon
. After having groomed your Pokémon at least seven times, she will give you Blue's phone number, which will allow you to arrange a rematch with him after winning your sixteenth Badge.
Professor Oak's Lab
Visit the laboratory to meet up with
the professor
. He claims to have a gift for you, but you must first defeat the remaining Kanto Gym Leaders to receive it.
Afterwards, you can speak to Oak to have him rate your
Pokédex
. There are currently 493 known species. It is also possible to use the
Pokégear
to have him rate your progress over the phone.
