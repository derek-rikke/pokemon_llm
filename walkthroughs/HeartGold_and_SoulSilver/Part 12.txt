1F
A Rocket Grunt blocks the stairs to 2F. His orders are to allow only people dressed in
Team Rocket
's uniform to pass.
Goldenrod Tunnel
Going Undercover
Visit
Goldenrod Tunnel
's Photo Booth to find another Rocket Grunt. He assumes that you are one of the new members recruited for the Radio Tower mission. They apparently ran out of uniforms, so he decided to "borrow" one from the studio. In an instant, you are dressed as just another Rocket Grunt!
Radio Tower
1F
Because of your disguise, the Rocket Grunt mistakes you for a new recruit and moves aside. Just as you are about to climb the stairs,
Silver
rushes in. He yells at the guard, demanding that the group stop harassing people. He recognizes you a moment later, and criticizes you for wearing the uniform. His words reveal you as an imposter, and you abandon the disguise. Realizing his mistake, the Rocket Grunt immediately draws you into battle.
Defeated, he rushes upstairs to warn the others. Silver finally understands the reason for your disguise, but dismisses it as a weak person's idea. He is happy to let you handle
Team Rocket
, as he is more interested in finding and defeating
Lance
. He warns you that he will be looking to defeat you next, and leaves.
2F
There are four Rocket Grunts patrolling the second floor. Battle past them to reach the western stairs.
3F
Battle another two Rocket Grunts and Scientist Garett. A Card Key is required to access the eastern area, so take the western stairs instead.
4F (West)
Beat the first Rocket Grunt and Scientist Trenton to reach the stairs to the Director's office.
5F (West)
The Director is being held captive here in his office, or at least that is how it seems at first. This man is an imposter, and is actually
Petrel
in disguise. Prepare for battle!

When the battle ends, Petrel reveals that the real Director is being held in the Underground Warehouse, behind the locked door in

Defeated, he wonders aloud if what
Lance
told him about not treating his Pokémon properly is true, but refuses to give up on becoming stronger.
The Shifting Shutters
After
Silver
leaves, there are two Rocket Grunts nearby. Defeat them and pick up a
Full Heal
to the west. Collect the
Smoke Ball
from the southwest corner, then turn your attention to the three buttons on the nearby wall. Each of these buttons controls a different group of shutters to the south. To reset the puzzle, either flip each switch again or leave and re-enter the room. Press the blue one on the left, then the green one in the middle, and then the red one on the right. After exiting the maze, defeat the female Rocket Grunt and pass through the double doors.
Warehouse
Go north to reach an
Ultra Ball
, then follow the winding hallway past the first Rocket Grunt to reach a
Max Ether
in the southeast corner. Battle a second Rocket Grunt in the northeast, then detour up the nearby stairs; this leads to a blocked-off area in the
Department Store
's basement and an
Amulet Coin
. Continue westward to fight a third Rocket Grunt. Pick up
TM82
(
Sleep Talk
) in the interior room, then speak to the Director. After hearing about
Team Rocket
occupying the
Radio Tower
, he begs for your help and gives you a
Card Key
. This card unlocks the shutter on the tower's third floor. Climb the northeast stairs again and take the elevator up from the basement.
Radio Tower
With the
Card Key
in hand, it is time to defeat
Team Rocket
once and for all!

Giovanni

Conceding defeat,
Archer
formally disbands
Team Rocket
, just as
Giovanni
did before him. The Rockets flee the building, and the Director returns a moment later. He exclaims that your courageous actions have saved Pokémon nationwide, and rewards you with a
Rainbow Wing
HG
/
Silver Wing
SS
. He explains that there used to be a different tower at this site, but it was old and unstable. During demolition to make way for the new Radio Tower, this gleaming feather was found at the top.
He explains that according to a friend of his from
Cianwood City
, having this feather allows the holder to meet a certain Legendary Pokémon. The Rainbow Wing allows the holder to climb the
Bell Tower
in
Ecruteak City
, while the Silver Wing grants passage to the deepest cave in the
Whirl Islands
. As he is about to leave, he suddenly remembers another detail from his friend: even with this feather, the Legendary Pokémon will not appear to just anyone. He wonders if there could be another item that triggers its appearance.
He then leaves for his office, leaving you free to return to
Mahogany Town
. As you exit the tower, speak to
DJ Mary
on 4F (East) for a
Pink Bow
, and the girl on 3F to get
TM11
(
Sunny Day
).
The next destination is
Blackthorn City
, to the east of
Mahogany Town
.
Mahogany Town
With
Team Rocket
gone, the souvenir shop's owner and her granddaughter have returned to reopen their store. The shady salesman who blocked the way eastward to
Route 44
has disappeared, as well.

The Clumsy Traveler
Backtrack and walk across the rocky ridge. There is a man standing to the east; when you approach, he asks if the item that you just found was an
HM
. He claims to be the one who dropped it, but asks that you keep it. Continue on and climb down the northeast ladder.
BF (North)
There are four boulders scattered around this part of the cave, and each one must be dropped through a different hole in the floor to form a path on the ice below. Go north and loop around the northwest corner to find the first two boulders near the middle of B1F.
Puzzle
Solution
Boulder 1
(To Southwest)
Right 1, Down 3, Left 5, Down 1, Right 1
Boulder 2
(To Northwest)
Up 4, Right 1, Down 1
Boulder 3
(To Southeast)
Left 1, Down 5, Left 1, Down 3, Up 1, Left 4
Boulder 4
(To Northeast)
Up 2, Right 2, Up 3, Left 2
Of the two boulders in the southwest area, begin with the southernmost one. Use
Strength
to maneuver it around the scattered rocks and drop it down through the southwest hole. Backtrack a bit and move the second boulder northward, so that it sits next to the lone stalagmite. Leave it here for a moment and head to the southeast area to find the third boulder. Move it to the southeast hole, then continue northward. Push the fourth boulder to the north-central hole, then go west to finish moving the second boulder to the northwest hole. With all four boulders cleared, climb down the northeast ladder.
B2F (West)
The four boulders from the floor above have fallen in a spiral shape that grants access to the ladder in the middle of the chamber. Before continuing on, there are several items that can be found nearby, including a
Max Potion
. To reach the middle area, begin in the northeast corner and slide westward across the ice to the first boulder. Move in a clockwise direction from here to reach the patch of clear ground in the center, and collect the
Full Heal
before climbing the ladder.
B3F
Use
Rock Smash
, or approach from the east, to reach the
NeverMeltIce
. Climb up the eastern ladder.
B2F (East)
Move southward and climb onto the rocky ridge. In the east-central area, stand five steps from the east wall at the edge of the ice, then slide south and east to reach
TM72
(
Avalanche
). Slide westward and climb up the ladder.
B1F (South)
First, go west and use
Strength
to move the boulder one step southward. Approach the ice patch from the south and use the boulder as a stopping point to reach the nearby
Iron
. Climb up the western ladder.
1F (Southeast)
Collect the
Protein
from the ridge to the north. Another
Kimono Girl
can be seen to the south.
The Kimono Girl
There is a gap two steps wide on the north edge of the ice patch. Begin from the east side, and slide down, left, down, then right to reach the girl. She explains that her sandals are frozen to the ground, and asks if you would give her a push on her back. After a hearty shove, she slides away to clear ground, and thanks you as she exits the cave.
From this spot, slide left, up, right, down, right, and down again to reach a
PP Up
. Return to the Kimono Girl's prior location and slide southward to the exit.
