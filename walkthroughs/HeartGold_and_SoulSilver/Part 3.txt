Violet City
is an old village surrounded by trees. The city stands between

to the east,
Route 32
to the south, and
Route 36
to the west. It is a common destination for new Pokémon Trainers, as a
Pokémon academy
and the
Violet Gym
are both located here. A tall building known as

stands on the north side of town.

Onix
in exchange for a
Bellsprout

31
and
32
.
Earl's Pokémon Academy
The local
Pokémon academy
is run by a man named
Earl Dervish
, who is initially found standing between the Gym and Poké Mart. Speak to him, and he asks if you have defeated the local Gym; say no, and he leads you to the school while he twirls around at every turn along the way. The school teaches inexperienced Trainers about the basics of battle. A blackboard in the front of the room describes the five status ailments that can affect a Pokémon.

From Elder Li, after defeating him

1F (Center)
The tower is three stories tall. The ground floor is open to tourists, who visit to see the unique style in which the tower is built. Pass by the swaying pillar and climb the stairs to 2F.
2F (Northeast)
Go east to battle Sage Nico and take the stairs back down to 1F.
1F (North)
Pick up the
Parlyz Heal
to the south. Head west to battle Sage Chow, then climb up the western stairway.
2F (Southwest)
Grab the
X Accuracy
to the north, then battle Sage Edmond in the southwest corner. Climb the southern stairway to 3F.
3F
Collect the
Potion
to the west. Continue northward to battle Sages Jin, Neal, and Troy.
When you pass the swaying pillar, you find that
Silver
has just defeated the elder Sage, Li. He acknowledges Silver's skill as a Pokémon Trainer and hands him a
Technical Machine
, but warns that he should not treat his Pokémon so harshly. Silver notices you at this point, and complains about the elder Sage being weak. He clearly has no intention of heeding the Sage's warning, as he is only interested in strong Pokémon that can win. He then uses an Escape Rope to leave the tower.
Pick up the
Escape Rope
in the northeast corner, then speak to Elder Li. He welcomes you to the tower, and offers to test the bonds between you and your Pokémon.
VS Elder Li
Grass-type
Pokémon like Li's two
Bellsprout
are vulnerable to
Fire
- and
Flying-type
attacks, so
Pidgey
,
Hoothoot
, and
Cyndaquil
will have little trouble getting past them. His Hoothoot, a Flying-type Pokémon, takes serious damage from
Rock-type
attacks.

When the battle is over, Li rewards you with
TM70
(
Flash
). This field move lights up even the darkest caves, but to use it outside of battle, you must first defeat the
Violet Gym
.
Violet Gym
Violet Gym
Violet City Pokémon Gym
Leader: Falkner
The Elegant Master of Flying Pokémon
The
Violet Gym
specializes in
Flying-type
Pokémon. Flying-type moves are super effective against
Bug
-,
Fighting
-, and
Grass-type
Pokémon, while Flying-type Pokémon are weak to
Electric
-,
Ice
-, and
Rock-type
moves.
The Gym's first floor is empty, except for a wooden platform that carries challengers to an upper level. There are two Gym Trainers on this elevated platform, but a semi-transparent walkway allows challengers to reach the
Gym Leader
directly.
Falkner
's
Pidgeotto
can use
Gust
to deal serious damage to
Bug
Pokémon, and
Grass-type
Pokémon like
Chikorita
. It may not be the most difficult Pokémon to defeat, but it is able to use
Roost
to restore its health and increase its longevity. Flying Pokémon can do little against the high
Defense
of
Rock-type
Pokémon; if you traded for the boy's
Onix
, counterattack with
Rock Throw
for an easy victory.

After the battle,
Falkner
awards you the
Zephyr Badge
, which ensures obedience of all Pokémon up to level 20 and enables the use of
Rock Smash
in the field. He also gives you
TM51
(
Roost
) as a prize.
Elm and the Egg
Professor Elm
calls when you step outside the Gym, and says that they have discovered something about the
Mystery Egg
. He does not go into detail, but wants you to bring the Egg along with you on your travels. He informs you that his aide is in the nearby Poké Mart, and asks that you pay him a visit.
Poké Mart
Elm
's aide is waiting for you near the counter. Agree to the professor's request, and he returns the
Mystery Egg
to you. It seems that after you left the lab, Elm got a phone call and he soon decided that no one would be more suited to care for an Egg than you. The aide goes on to explain that in order for a Pokémon to grow and hatch from an Egg, it must spend time with other active Pokémon. He then leaves to return to the lab.
The Mysterious Girl
When you leave the Poké Mart, you are met by a
mysterious girl dressed in a kimono
. She notices the
Mystery Egg
, and realizes that it was passed from
Mr. Pokémon
, to
Professor Elm
, to you. She calls it an important Egg and asks that you take good care of it for her, before leaving southward.
