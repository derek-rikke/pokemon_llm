Missing Child
Soon after boarding the ship, a Gentleman bumps into you. The man is distraught, and apologies as he explains that his young granddaughter is missing. He asks that you let him know if she is found, and hurries off to continue his search.
The Search Begins
Professor Elm
's
S.S. Ticket
reserves a cabin in the hallway to the right, marked by a Sailor standing just outside. The room features a
PC
and a cozy bed, the perfect place to take a nap and restore health.
The cabin across the hallway belongs to Firebreather Lyle. Of the two cabins between here and the entrance, one is empty while the other has only a sleeping Sailor. On the opposite end of the ship, the first pair of cabins both have Trainers looking to battle; Poké Fan Colin and Twins Meg & Peg are found in the cabin opposite the entrance, and Hiker Noland can be found in the other. The Gentleman's cabin is at the end of the hallway, on the opposite side from the entrance. The final cabin is empty. There is no unaccompanied little girl to be found here, so head downstairs to check the lower deck.
B1F
The room to the left has six beds, and a seasick Juggler Fritz hunched over a trash can. The first room to the right holds a dining area and Sailor Jeff.
A Sailor blocks the way to the engine room. Speak to him, and he asks that you find another Sailor for him as he cannot leave his post.
1F
Head back toward your cabin and enter the one next door. Speak to the drowsy Sailor Stanly, and he immediately jumps up out of bed. He is offended that you would think he was sleeping, and challenges you to battle. Defeat him, and he returns to his post.
B1F
If you speak to the Sailor, he thanks you for finding Stanly. There is no little girl to be found in the engine room either, so battle Picnicker Debra if you like, then climb the ladder up to the Captain's cabin.
1F
Captain's cabin
The little girl is located here, safe but bored, and keeps trying to get the Captain to play with her. Speak to her, and she insists on playing a game of hide-and-seek. She disappears in an instant, but fortunately cannot leave the ship.
B1F
Return to the engine room and visit the dead-end area at the opposite end of the ship to find the little girl hiding in a corner. Speak to her, and you accompany her back to her grandfather's cabin. As thanks for seeing his granddaughter returned safely, he rewards you with a
Metal Coat
. A moment later, the Captain announces that the ship has now arrived in
Vermilion City
.
After this initial trip to
Kanto
, the ship sails from Kanto to
Johto
every Sunday and Wednesday, and from Johto to Kanto every Monday and Friday.
Vermilion City
Vermilion City
Vermilion City
is a popular port city located between
Route 6
and
Route 11
. Vermilion Harbor sees many ships coming and going, and the Pokémon Fan Club is located on the west side of town. The
Vermilion Gym
stands in the southwest. Just outside the city limits, a sleeping
Snorlax
blocks the way to Route 11 and
Diglett's Cave
.

Chasing the Wind
As you approach the second turn along the path from the harbor, you find
Suicune
standing on the water to the east. It races off as soon as you spot it, and
Eusine
appears a moment later. He had hoped to corner the beast by ambushing it here, but did not plan for it running on the water. He mentions how he is starting to see a pattern, and hurries off.
Pokémon Fan Club
The Pokémon Fan Club is located on the west side of town. Members meet here to discuss everything about their favorite Pokémon, and include a woman with her
Bayleef
and a man who wishes that he had a
Clefairy
. Speak to the Chairman to hear a long-winded story about his prized
Rapidash
. He eventually realizes how long he has been speaking, and gives you a
Rare Candy
as thanks for hearing him out.
Vermilion Gym
Vermilion Gym
Vermilion City Pokémon Gym
Leader: Lt. Surge
The Lightning American
The
Vermilion Gym
specializes in
Electric-type
Pokémon. Electric-type moves are super effective against
Flying
- and
Water-type
Pokémon, while Electric-type Pokémon are weak to
Ground-type
moves.
The Gym Leader can be found in the back room, beyond a set of electric fences. Reaching him requires challengers to
flip two switches
hidden randomly among the many trash cans. Once the first switch has been found, the second will be in an adjacent can. If the wrong can is inspected and there is no switch inside, the puzzle resets.
Lt. Surge
leads with his
Raichu
.
Double Team
makes it difficult to hit, while
Thunder Wave
paralyzes
the target and cuts its
Speed
. Surge's first
Electrode
is more defensive than the other, with Double Team and
Light Screen
letting it take less damage than normal when it does get hit. His second Electrode is more offense-oriented;
Screech
cuts the target's
Defense
, allowing it to deal more damage with
Selfdestruct
. His final two Pokémon help to cover his team's weaknesses. Many
Ground-type
Pokémon are also part-
Rock
, and take serious damage from
Steel-type
moves like
Magneton
's
Mirror Shot
, and
Fighting-type
moves like
Electabuzz
's
Low Kick
. Electric Pokémon tend to have higher
Speed
, so consider making use of items like
Quick Claw
and
X Speed
.
