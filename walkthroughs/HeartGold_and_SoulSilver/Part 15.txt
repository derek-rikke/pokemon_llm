Welcome to Kanto!
When you step out of the water, you draw the attention of a man standing nearby. He asks if you know what you have just done, and excitedly informs you that you have just taken your first step into the
Kanto
region.
Tohjo Falls
Tohjo Falls
is a small cave in southwest
Kanto
that serves to link the two regions together. As it cannot be cleared before obtaining
HM07
(
Waterfall
) and the
Rising Badge
, it also acts as a natural barrier so that only the strongest Trainers continue onward to the
Pokémon League
at
Indigo Plateau
.

Go north and use
Strength
to move the boulder one step northward. Go down the southwest stairway, then turn around and head east to reach a
Potion
. Climb the next stairway to cross the bridge, then walk down the stairway to the west. Pass under the bridge to reach a
Full Heal
, then turn west. Move northward to reach a narrow passage littered with stones; move the southern of the two boulders here to reach a
Max Revive
. Go west and climb the northwest ladder.
2F (Southwest)
Go south and move eastward across the ridge. Climb up the eastern ladder.
3F (Southeast)
Jump down through the hole in the floor to return to 2F.
2F (East)
Move northward to find a boulder sitting near several stairways. Use
Strength
to push it one step westward; this clears a path to the nearby
Full Restore
. Push it back eastward to continue north and climb up the northeast ladder.
3F (Northeast)
Go south and pass by the hole in the floor. Turn west to climb onto the rocky ridge and collect an
Ultra Ball
near the north wall. Move southwest to find two more holes in the floor. Jump down through the northern one.

Pick up the
HP Up
, then jump the ledge and climb up the ladder.
3F (West)
Follow the tunnel northward to find two branching paths; go north from here and jump down through the hole in the floor.
2F
Walk down the stairway to the west to reach
TM26
(
Earthquake
). Moving the nearby boulder creates a shortcut to the cave entrance, if necessary. Climb back up the stairway, then climb the ladder back to 3F.
3F (West)
Go east, jump the ledge, and head north. Pass by the hole in the floor to reach a
Rare Candy
. Turn south, jump the second ledge, then use
Rock Smash
to reach
TM79
(
Dark Pulse
). Take a moment to tend to your Pokémon, then move northward around the ridge again. The exit is a short distance to the north.
Ambush!
Before you can reach the exit,
Silver
appears once again. He asks if you are headed to the Pokémon League, and if you saw any other "real" Trainers in the cave. He implies that he defeated them all by calling them spineless, and admits that making it this far proves that you are not part of that group. He promises to end your journey here as well, and draws you into battle.
Rival Battle 5
Each of
Silver
's Pokémon has grown a few more levels since the last battle. His
Magnemite
has since evolved into
Magneton
, and the Pokémon that he took from
Elm
's lab has now evolved into its final form. He has recently added a
Kadabra
to his team, as well; as a
Psychic-type
Pokémon, Kadabra has low physical
Defense
and takes serious damage from
Bug
-,
Ghost
-, and
Dark-type
attacks.
