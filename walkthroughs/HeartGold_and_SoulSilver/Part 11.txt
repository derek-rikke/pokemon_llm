The Pushy Salesman
There is a man on the east side of town that stops anyone from reaching
Route 44
. He states that as you are new in town, you should definitely try a
RageCandyBar
for the low price of
$
300. The item is a local specialty, named for the nearby
Lake of Rage
.
The Shady Sightseer
A second man blocks the entrance to the
Mahogany Gym
as well. He asks if you have seen
a man with a black cape
who has been investigating strange radio waves near
Mahogany Town
and the
Lake of Rage
, and wonders aloud who he may be. The lake is located to the north, beyond
Route 43
.
Route 43
Route 43
Route 43
connects
Mahogany Town
to the
Lake of Rage
. The main road passes through a gate, while a grassy trail winds its way through the trees.

Lake of Rage
Lake of Rage
The
Lake of Rage
, also known as
Gyarados
Lake, is the largest lake in
Johto
. According to a local Fishing Guru, the lake was created when rampaging Gyarados altered the landscape and the resulting crater eventually filled with rainwater. The lake has not been the same since
the men dressed in black
appeared, and there have even been sightings of a
strangely-colored Gyarados
. The area experiences frequent
rainfall
, which often leaves the western woods submerged.

Peace Disturbed
Something has been disturbing the Pokémon living in the lake, and now the
Gyarados
are angry. One of them can be seen just offshore. Unlike others of its species, this individual seems to have evolved under mysterious circumstances that resulted in its
unusual coloring
. It will not calm itself, so it must be caught or defeated.
VS Gyarados
As a
Water
/
Flying
-type Pokémon,
Gyarados
is vulnerable to
Electric
- and
Rock-type
attacks. Using these moves first will wear it down quickly. Follow up with
Fire
-, Water-,
Fighting
-,
Bug
-, or
Steel-type
moves to further chip away at its health.

When the battle ends, you find a

floating on the water. Climb back onto shore and speak to the man reading the sign. He has been investigating rumors that all of the
Magikarp
in the lake are being forced to evolve prematurely. He introduces himself as
Lance
, and asks for your help. He believes that a mysterious radio signal originating in
Mahogany Town
is the cause, and flies off on his
Dragonite
to find the source.
Mahogany Town
Just a Souvenir Shop
Upon entering the shady shop, you see
Lance

using

Continue west and take the first doorway to head south. Defeat Scientist Gregg in the interior room, then grab the

and examine the computer to disable the security cameras. Leave the room and head east to reach a
Hyper Potion
. Go south and follow the hallway westward to get a
Nugget
, then take the stairs in the southwest.
B2F (South)
Lance
is waiting for you here, and heals your Pokémon before continuing on. The nearby door to the Radio Transmitter features a voice-recognition system so that only approved people may enter. Continue eastward to fight another two Rocket Grunts. Take the stairs down to the lowest floor.
B3F (Southeast)
Lance
informs you that reaching the boss requires the voice of a certain person, and identifies this person as
Petrel
, a Rocket Executive. It seems that the man is hiding out in their leader's office, which is protected with two passwords. Pick up the
Full Heal
near the east wall, then battle Scientist Ross and the female Rocket Grunt in the eastern room. Defeated, she gives up the first password: "
SlowpokeTail
". Move on to the southwest room to fight Scientist Mitch, then defeat another Rocket Grunt to learn the second password: "
RaticateTail
." Collect the
X Special
and
Protein
near the potted plants, then head north. Pick up
TM49
(
Snatch
) near the north wall, then climb the northeast stairs.
B2F (North)
Head all the way to the west, where you are challenged by another Rocket Grunt. Go down the stairs to reach the boss's room.
B3F (Northwest)
When you approach the Executive's room,
Silver
appears. He insists that he will be the one to eliminate
Team Rocket
, then runs off. Before opening the door, climb the southern stairs to a separate area of B2F.
B2F (West)
Pick up the item,
TM46
(
Thief
), then go back downstairs.
B3F (Northwest)
Collect the
Ultra Ball
to the east, then examine the door to enter the two passwords, and the door opens. The man inside identifies himself as
Giovanni
, the leader of
Team Rocket
. He soon abandons his disguise after realizing that he does not sound the same, and reveals himself as
Petrel
, one of the group's Executives. Petrel assumes that you are headed to the Radio Transmitter, and reveals the password: "Hail Giovanni". It does little good however, as the door will not open unless the password is spoken with his voice.

Petrel
explains that

disappeared after disbanding
Team Rocket
three years ago
, but that the group has continued on since then, planning for his eventual return. He hurries off, and the

that was standing in the corner approaches you and recites the password, mimicking Petrel's voice. It soon wanders off, so hurry after it as it leads you back to the southern part of B2F.
B2F (South)
When you approach the door to the Radio Transmitter,
Murkrow
screams the password as it mimicks

Ariana
, and a Rocket Grunt ambush you in an attempt to force a 2-on-1 battle, but their plan is short-lived.
Lance
and his
Dragonite
show up just in time, turning the fight into a 2-on-2 battle, instead.

Afterward,

Mahogany Gym
Mahogany Gym
Mahogany Town Pokémon Gym
Leader: Pryce
The Teacher of Winter's Harshness
The
Mahogany Gym
specializes in
Ice-type
Pokémon. Ice-type moves are super effective against
Dragon
-,
Flying
-,
Grass
-, and
Ground-type
Pokémon, while Ice-type Pokémon are weak to
Fighting
-,
Fire
-,
Rock
-, and
Steel-type
moves.
The Gym is filled with slippery, ice-like tiles. When stepped on, the challenger is sent sliding until they reach a patch of normal flooring or some other obstacle. In the first room, slide northward to the ice block, then move west, north, east, and north again. In the second room, stand near Skier Diana and slide eastward to the ice block, then loop around from the same direction to continue northward. In the third room, battle Boarder Deandre, then slide eastward to the nearest ice block. Slide north and battle Skier Jill, then move east, south, and west. This leads to the large stalagmite in the southwest corner. slide north, east, north, east, and north again to battle Boarder Gerardo. Finally, move west then north to reach the
Gym Leader
.
Pryce
's
Seel
is vulnerable to
Grass
- and
Electric-type
moves. Despite being a
Water-type
Pokémon, it can still fight back against unsuspecting Grass Pokémon with
Ice
attacks. His
Dewgong
is much the same, but also takes serious damage from
Rock
- and
Fighting-type
moves. His
Piloswine
can use
Blizzard
, the strongest
Ice-type
attack, but its
Ice
/
Ground
typing leaves it with the most weaknesses of Pryce's team, with five: Fighting-,
Steel
-,
Fire
-,
Water
-, and Grass-type moves.
