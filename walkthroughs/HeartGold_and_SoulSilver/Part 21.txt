Pal Park
Pal Park
In
Pal Park
, you can gather six Pokémon at a time from
any
previous
adventure
, and import them to the preserve. The park is divided into five different areas—field, forest, mountain, pond, and sea—and once inside, each migrated Pokémon appears in the area that best resembles its natural habitat.
In addition to transferring Pokémon from other regions, the preserve also utilizes a rating system to calculate the value of the migrated Pokémon. The final score is reported at the end of the Catching Show by the Park Ranger, who hands out a random Berry depending on your total. Rarer and legendary Pokémon receive higher values, while common Pokémon receive lower values. Timing is also a factor; more points are awarded for completing the challenge quickly. On your first visit, the current record-holder is
Silver
with 2,000 points.

The Poisonous Ninja Master
The

Fuchsia Gym
is the same ninja training ground that it always has been, complete with invisible walls. However,
Koga
's promotion to the Elite Four left a vacant Gym Leader position, a title now held by his daughter,
Janine
. She and her Gym Trainers are adept at disguise, dressing alike to conceal the Gym Leader's true location.
Psychic-type
attacks will see the greatest effectiveness, but as many of the Pokémon here are part-
Grass
or part-
Ground
as well, they are also vulnerable to
Fire
and
Water
moves, respectively. As Janine is still inexperienced, her Pokémon's levels have only reached the 40s, so almost any attack from your battle-tested team can take them out quickly. In addition, four of her five Pokémon—all but
Weezing
—share a weakness to
Rock-type
moves. Look out for
Toxic
,
Confuse Ray
, and
Explosion
, and cure status ailments as soon as possible.
