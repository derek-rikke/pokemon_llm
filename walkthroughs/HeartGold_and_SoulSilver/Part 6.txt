Goldenrod City
Goldenrod City
is a sprawling metropolis located in western
Johto
, between Routes
34
and
35
. It is the region's largest city, and a major hub of economy and telecommunications. The
Goldenrod Department Store
offers a wide variety of goods, and
an underground shopping district
has its own selection. The
Radio Tower
broadcasts several informative programs, while patrons aim to hit the jackpot at the local
Game Corner
. A
bicycle shop
headquartered in
Kanto
has recently acquired a second location here, while the high-speed
Magnet Train
links the two neighboring regions. The
Goldenrod Gym
can be found in the northeast part of the city, next to a flower shop.

The basement is only accessible by elevator. A pair of Black Belts and a few

are working to renovate the area. Several smaller side rooms are blocked by large blue crates. Speak to each Black Belt while he faces a Machoke; this causes him to direct the Pokémon to move the crate aside, opening the smaller room. There is an

, on Routes
34
and
35
.
An Intriguing Impression
On Sundays, a second vendor appears behind the counter. Speak to her, and she will assess how your lead Pokémon feels about you. If it is
friendly
toward you, she hands out
TM27

TM21
(

Friendship checker
The house to the northeast of the department store belongs to a woman who can evaluate the
friendliness
of the first Pokémon in your party. There are
certain Pokémon
that can only be acquired when a Pokémon is happy with its Trainer. There are
many things
that can be done in order to deepen a Pokémon's friendship with its Trainer, like
grooming
it or feeding it
vitamins
.
Bike Shop
Bike Shop, interior
The
Bike Shop
has recently moved to the city's southeast neighborhood from the
Kanto
region, but is having trouble attracting customers. Recognizing the great deal of traveling you will be doing as a Pokémon Trainer, the owner asks to loan you a
Bicycle
. His hope is that others will see you riding one of his bikes and be interested enough to visit his shop. He takes down your contact information, and soon you have a brand new Bicycle. Riding a bike is faster than traveling on foot, and the owner gains new customers—everybody wins!
Sometime later, you receive a call from the owner. He says that business is better now that people have seen you with one of his Bikes, and lets you keep the one he lent you to show his thanks.
Magnet Train Station
The
Magnet Train
station is located in the northwest part of the city. The high-speed train links Goldenrod City to
Saffron City
, in the middle of the neighboring
Kanto
region. With a
Pass
, it is normally possible for visitors to board the train at any time. However, it seems to be running late and has not yet returned from its latest journey into Kanto.
Goldenrod Radio Tower
The
Goldenrod Radio Tower
stands tall in the northwest part of the city. It is the source of all
Pokégear
broadcasts in
Johto
. Visitors are allowed on the first and second floors, while the upper floors are restricted to authorized personnel only.

Pokémon Lottery Corner
A woman behind the front desk named Felicity runs the
Pokémon Lottery Corner

ID Numbers
of your Pokémon, and if any of these numbers are a full or partial match, you win a prize.

Fashion Case
as a gift to store Accessories.
Herbal shop
The southern booth houses a
shop that offers herbal medicine
. These items heal or revive Pokémon for a cheaper price than traditional medicine. However, Pokémon do not enjoy their bitter taste, so using them on a Pokémon will lessen its
friendship
rating. This shop is only open on weekends.

$

$

. Their shop is closed on Mondays.
Bargain shop
The northern booth houses a bargain shop, which is only open on Mondays from 4:00 am to 9:00 am. This merchant deals in valuable items; while having no use themselves, they can be resold elsewhere for decent profit. Only one of each item may be purchased per week.

The first man allows visitors to dress up as a
Team Rocket Grunt
and take
photos
with their party Pokémon. These photos can then be viewed from the
PC
.
The second man gives Trainers a chance to dress up their Pokémon using up to ten
Accessories
from the
Fashion Case
before having their photo taken. These photos are framed and displayed in the gallery to the north. A Hiker in this gallery runs a raffle; for
$
100, entrants may win one of 39 Accessories or one of 14
Backdrops
.
Name Rater
The house near the city's north exit belongs to the
Name Rater
. Here, Trainers can have the
nicknames
of their Pokémon rated and, if the Pokémon's
ID number
matches the
Trainer's ID number
, the nickname can be changed. If the Pokémon was caught by the Trainer that currently owns it, he says that the name could be better and offers the chance to change it. If the Pokémon was obtained via a
trade
, he says that the name is perfect and refuses to change it.
Goldenrod Gym
Goldenrod Gym
Goldenrod City Pokémon Gym
Leader: Whitney
The Incredibly Pretty Girl!
The
Goldenrod Gym
specializes in
Normal-type
Pokémon. Normal-type moves are not super-effective against any Pokémon, while Normal-type Pokémon are weak to
Fighting-type
moves.
The Gym is filled with potted plants, and features a large central room in the shape of a
Clefairy
. Go north and walk up the first stairway, then continue north to battle Beauty Victoria. Turn east, walk down the northeast stairway, and enter the central room through the northeast doorway. Move southwest to battle Lass Carrie, then turn northward to draw Lass Cathy's attention. Once she has been defeated, circle around behind her to reach the
Gym Leader
.
Whitney
's
Clefairy
may not be much of a problem on its own, but there is always a chance that using
Metronome
calls a powerful attack if luck is on its side. The more pressing threat is her
Miltank
. It has high
Defense
and
Speed
, and can restore its health with
Milk Drink
. Its most dangerous move is
Rollout
, which doubles in power for each consecutive hit. The easiest way to oppose the Goldenrod Gym is to bring the
Machop
available for
trade
in the Department Store. Its
Fighting-type
moves will deal serious damage to Whitney's Pokémon, and Miltank's Rollout is not very effective against Fighting-type Pokémon.

After the battle,
Whitney
sobs uncontrollably. Unable to claim your new Badge, you turn to leave when Lass Cathy steps in. According to her, Whitney always cries when she loses, but will compose herself soon. Speak to Whitney again, and she finally awards you the
Plain Badge
, which enables the use of
Strength
in the field. She also gives out
TM45
(
Attract
) as a prize. Afterward, she claims to have heard that a venue called the
Pokéathlon Dome
has recently opened next to the
National Park
, and suggests that you try it out since you are so good at battling.
Goldenrod Flower Shop
Before you leave for
Route 35
, be sure to stop by the flower shop to the east-northeast of the Gym. Speak to the woman inside to learn of an
odd tree
on
Route 36
that actually squirms around to avoid contact with water. She believes that it could be dangerous, but seeing that you have the
Plain Badge
, decides that you will be alright on your own and gives you a
SquirtBottle
so that you can see for yourself.
