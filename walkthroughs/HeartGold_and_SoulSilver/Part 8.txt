. The city honors its past by preserving long-held traditions, like the old-fashioned architecture of the local dance theater and the two towers that stand to the north. Several legendary Pokémon have ties to the area, giving Ecruteak an air of mystery.

Visit the southwest house and speak to the man inside. He gives you a

, a device that can detect any hidden items nearby.
Pokémon Center
Meet Bill
Enter the Pokémon Center to meet
Bill
, the creator of the
Pokémon Storage System
. He may have been the one to invent the program, but he credits
Lanette
, an associate of his from the distant
Hoenn
region, for making it easier to use. He mentions how he and his friends from all around the world are always working to improve the trading and storage systems, then leaves for home in
Goldenrod City
.
Ecruteak Dance Theater
When you first enter the Dance Theater, you witness one of the
Kimono Girls
being harassed by a
Team Rocket
Grunt. He criticizes her dancing, and demands that she perform a dance that is less "serious". She refuses, and he then begins to demonstrate the kind of dance he would like to see by spinning around onstage himself. Speak to him to pull the troublemaker into battle!
Afterward, he suddenly remembers that he has a mission to complete, and runs off. If you speak to the Kimono Girl, she mentions how you are kind and strong, and how "that person" certainly knows what to look for in people. When pressed, she explains that she was only talking to herself. Upon leaving the stage, the Gentleman in the audience approaches you, and rewards your courage with
HM03
(
Surf
).
Burned Tower
Burned Tower, 1F
Burned Tower, B1F
The charred ruins of the
Burned Tower
lie in the northwest part of the city. Formerly known as the Brass Tower, it was once as majestic as the
Bell Tower
to the east. When it was new, it was said to be the roost of
a silvery, sparkling Pokémon
. But centuries later, a heavy storm rolled in and the tower was struck by lightning, igniting a great fire that would rage for three days. The silver Pokémon and
the rainbow-hued Pokémon
that roosted on the Bell Tower escaped to the skies unharmed, and the silver Pokémon flew away, never to return. A sudden downpour would finally douse the flames, and the rainbow Pokémon gave new life to
three nameless Pokémon
that perished in the blaze before it flew off as well.

Upon entering the ruined tower, you can see
three majestic Pokémon
through the crumbling floor. There are also two men nearby; when you approach them, the first man introduces himself as
Eusine
. He has been tracking a Pokémon named
Suicune
, and heard rumors that it was here. He directs you to peer through the hole in the floor, and states that the Pokémon is downstairs. However, he cannot approach any closer as it would simply run away, as it has several times before. If spoken to, the second man introduces himself as
Morty
, the
Ecruteak City
Gym Leader
. He is here to investigate as well, both to help his friend and to properly understand the city's legends as its Gym Leader.
Ambush!
When you approach the ladder to B1F, you are ambushed again by
Silver
. He is looking for the legendary Pokémon that are supposed to be here, and accuses you of trying to get to them first. He aims to stop you, and draws you into battle.
Rival Battle 3
Silver
has added another new Pokémon to his team since the previous battle.
Magnemite
takes serious damage from
Fire
-,
Ground
-, and
Fighting-type
attacks. For Trainers who chose
Cyndaquil
, or traded for the
Machop
in
Goldenrod City
, it will likely be little threat. His
Gastly
is still vulnerable to the same
Ghost
-,
Psychic
-, and
Dark-type
moves. Use
Rock
- and
Electric-type
moves against his
Zubat
for greatest effect. The Pokémon that he took from
Elm
's lab has grown a few levels but otherwise has changed little since the previous battle.

Afterward, Silver shrugs off his loss as he moves to leave the tower, declaring that you would never be able to catch a legendary Pokémon anyway.
Exploring the Ruins
Go north from the ladder to battle Firebreather Ned. Move westward along the few remaining floorboards to pick up an
Antidote
and fight Firebreather Richard. Turn south to find an
HP Up
behind a breakable rock, then backtrack and climb down the ladder.
B1F
On the lower level, you find yourself standing before
three mysterious Pokémon
. They do not react until approached, when two of the three immediately dash off in different directions and begin
racing across the land
.
Suicune
pauses for a moment to examine you before rushing off like the others. They can be encountered almost anywhere but flee from humans immediately. After seeing them in battle, the Pokédex tracks their movements.
Eusine
appears a moment later. He excitedly asks if you saw
Suicune
run past, and says that he has been chasing the beast for ten years but has never been this close to it. According to him, Suicune took notice of your presence, and
Ecruteak
's legendary Pokémon are said to only appear before people when they recognize their talents. He wonders aloud if he should be more aggressive in his search, and bids you goodbye until next time.
Tin Tower
The
Bell Tower
stands tall in the northeast part of the city. It is a sacred place, and is off-limits to all but a few people. Ecruteak's Fog Badge gets you inside, but no higher than the first floor. Two
legendary
artifacts
are required to reach the rest of the tower.
Ecruteak Gym
Ecruteak Gym
Ecruteak City Pokémon Gym
Leader: Morty
The Mystic Seer of the Future
The
Ecruteak Gym
specializes in
Ghost-type
Pokémon. Ghost-type moves are super effective against Ghost- and
Psychic-type
Pokémon, while Ghost-type Pokémon are weak to Ghost- and
Dark-type
moves.
Normal
- and
Fighting-type
moves will have no effect.
The Gym features what appears to be a bottomless pit, with a narrow bridge crossing over it. Challengers who step in the wrong place are returned to the entrance. The Gym Trainers are positioned along this walkway, with the path to the
Gym Leader
mostly follows each Gym Trainer's line of sight.
Morty
's Pokémon tend to use indirect attacks to harass their target.
Spite
and
Curse
drain the target's energy, while
Lick
and
Hypnosis
can inflict status ailments. Most of his Pokémon can even use
Mean Look
to prevent escape.
Ghost-type
Pokémon are vulnerable to Ghost- and
Dark-type
moves, but
Psychic-type
attacks are an equally effective way to target their secondary
Poison
typing, instead.
