Lavender Town
House of Memories
Lavender Town
is still a small town, though it experienced a big change during the last three years as
Pokémon Tower
was converted into the region's new Radio Tower.
Kanto Radio Tower
The tower security has been on alert ever since Johto's
Radio Tower
was taken over by
Team Rocket
, so visitors are restricted to the first floor. Accessing Kanto's radio programs requires an
EXPN Card
for the Pokégear. However, an incident at the
Kanto Power Plant
has disrupted the tower's energy supply, so you must restore power before you can obtain the EXPN Card.
House of Memories
The
House of Memories
was built to accommodate the departed Pokémon from the former
Pokémon Tower
site. There are several graves on the ground floor, and many more located in underground chambers that are off-limits to all but the caretaker,
Mr. Fuji
.
Name Rater
The
Name Rater
lives in the southeast house, and allows Trainers to rename any of their Pokémon. However, he cannot rename a Pokémon obtained in a trade.
Route 10 (south)
Route 10
The south side of
Route 10
has only two Trainers between
Lavender Town
and
Rock Tunnel
. The
Kanto Power Plant
is located nearby, but can only be reached by surfing downriver from
Route 9
.
