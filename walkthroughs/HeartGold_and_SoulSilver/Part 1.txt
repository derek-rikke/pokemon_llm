Introduction
After a brief cutscene, press the A Button or
Start
on the title screen. The player is first presented with three options,
Control Info
,
Adventure Info
, and
No Info Needed
.
Control Info
explains that tapping on the Touch Screen can be used to confirm selections and advance conversations. Different actions may be displayed with the A Button icon on the lower screen, depending on the situation. If the dual-screen icon is shown in the message window, then there are active buttons that may be pressed on the Touch Screen. The various buttons and their effects are then displayed.

Adventure Info
gives background information about the player's "grand adventure". It is recommended that the player speak to everyone they find and investigate things wherever they may be, as doing so gathers the information needed to overcome challenges, solve mysteries, and discover the way forward. By overcoming the challenges posed by other Trainers and wild Pokémon, the player will grow stronger, but this is not the game's only goal. The more important objective is the hope that the player meets countless people and, through them, achieves personal growth.
Selecting
No Info Needed
causes the famous Pokémon researcher,
Professor Oak
, to appear and introduce new Trainers to the Pokémon world. Next, the player is prompted to select a gender for their character, and to enter the character's name, which may be up to seven characters long. With that done, the player is transported into the world of Pokémon to begin their adventure!
New Bark Town
New Bark Town
Player's bedroom
The journey begins in
New Bark Town
, in the southeast part of the
Johto
region. It is a rather small, sleepy town with only four buildings. The northeastern house belongs to you and
Mom
, while the southeastern one is home to your friend,
Lyra
/
Ethan
. The large building to the north is Elm's Laboratory, where the resident researcher of the Johto region lives with his family on the second floor. The west side of town leads to the
tall grasses
of
Route 29
, and the waters to the east open up to
Route 27
.

The journey begins in your bedroom. The
PC
can be used to access your Mailbox and view any
Mail
that you may have received. There is already one entry stored here, a message from your friend,
Lyra
/
Ethan
, that proclaims their love of Pokémon.
1F
Mom
is sitting at the table, and approaches you when you walk downstairs. She tells you that
Lyra
/
Ethan
was just here, playing hide-and-seek with their
Marill
. She suddenly remembers that
Professor Elm
has been looking for you, as he has a favor to ask, and reminds you that his laboratory is located right next door. She then prepares you to go out by handing you your
Bag
and
Trainer Card
.
Buttons for Bag, Trainer Card, Save, and Options now appear on the Touch Screen.
To leave the house, step on the floor mat along the south wall and press Down on the +Control Pad.
A Friendly Face
When you first step outside, a
Marill
excitedly runs up to you, mistaking you for its Trainer.
Lyra
/
Ethan
leaves the second floor of the lab a moment later, and the two return to their home.
The Spy
A young, red-haired man
can be seen peering into Elm's Lab through a side window. If you try to speak to him, he shoves you back before returning to the window.
Professor Elm's Lab
Professor Elm
has been waiting for you. He gives a bit of background info about his research, explaining that before the Poké Ball was invented, Pokémon used to walk alongside their Trainer, just as
Lyra
/
Ethan
does with
Marill
. He continues, saying that although keeping Pokémon in Poké Balls is convenient, there must be advantages to having them walk alongside people, as it may affect their growth or evolution. Elm declares that he is going to give you a Pokémon, and asks that you let it travel outside of its Poké Ball to find out if his research is true. He directs you to a large machine with three Poké Balls to choose from.
Before you can do so, Elm notices that he has received an email. An acquaintance of his, nicknamed
Mr. Pokémon
, studies Pokémon as a hobby and regularly contacts the professor about his findings. Elm suggests that these discoveries are not usually as exciting as they are made out to be, and assumes it to be another
Pokémon Egg
. He and his aides are busy with their research, so he asks that you go in his place. To accompany you on the trip, he lets you choose one of his rare Pokémon. Each has its advantages and disadvantages, so simply choose the one that you like the best.

The
Grass-type
Chikorita
does well against
Water
-,
Rock
-, and
Ground-type
Pokémon. It also has the most weaknesses of the trio, and fares poorly against
Fire
-,
Flying
-,
Bug
-,
Poison
-, and
Ice-type
attacks. Chikorita may struggle early on, making it better suited for those looking for a challenge.
The
Fire-type
Cyndaquil
is great when battling
Grass
-,
Bug
-,
Ice
-, and
Steel-type
Pokémon, but is vulnerable to
Water
-,
Rock
-, and
Ground-type
moves. Cyndaquil's typing gives it an easier time in the early part of the game, making it a good choice for less experienced Trainers.
The
Water-type
Totodile
has an advantage when facing
Fire
-,
Rock
-, and
Ground-type
Pokémon, but may struggle against
Grass
- and
Electric-type
attacks. It is the most well-rounded of the trio.
After choosing your
first partner Pokémon
, you are given the chance to choose a
nickname
for it. A nickname may be up to ten characters long. The young Pokémon pops out of its Poké Ball, and Elm tells you that you may use the machine behind him to heal your Pokémon at any time. He informs you that
Mr. Pokémon
lives a short distance from
Cherrygrove City
, to the west of
New Bark Town
.
As you leave the building, his aide gives you five
Potions
.
Meet Up with Lyra/Ethan
When you leave the lab with your new Pokémon,
Lyra
/
Ethan
and
Marill
are waiting for you. She/He is excited to see the Pokémon that you chose, and suggests showing it to
Mom
.
Home
Speak to
Mom
, and she compliments your new Pokémon. After learning about Elm's task, she tells you that your
Pokégear
is back from the repair shop, and hands it to you.
The Pokégear button now appears on the Touch Screen.
She goes on to explain that the Pokégear is a handy device that every Trainer should have. It can even make phone calls by selecting the Phone icon and tapping on the name of a registered contact. The device has one contact listed, as Mom's phone number is already included.
One More Thing
As you approach
Route 29
,
Professor Elm
leaves his lab and catches up to you. He forgot to do this earlier, and gives you his phone number for your
Pokégear
.
Route 29
Route 29
Route 29
is a hilly path that runs west from
New Bark Town
to
Cherrygrove City
. Westbound travelers must pass through patches of
tall grass
, while eastbound travelers can jump over a series of
ledges
to avoid these grasses and the wild Pokémon inside. To the north,
Route 46
leads down from the mountains.

An Apricorn a Day
The tree on the northwest hill is an
Apricorn
Tree. Apricorns are a type of fruit that can be processed into Poké Balls, or blended into drinks that improve a Pokémon's
athletic performance
. There are seven variations of the fruit, with this particular tree producing
Green Apricorns
. These trees produce one Apricorn per day. However, it is impossible to pick any yet without a container in which to store them.
