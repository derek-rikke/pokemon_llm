Mt. Silver
is a tough, forbidding mountain that towers over the border between
Johto
and
Kanto
. The terrain is so treacherous and the wild Pokémon are so strong that only those who have earned
Professor Oak
's permission are allowed to enter. The sprawling caves may exhaust even the most seasoned adventurers, so it may be wise to bring a supply of
Max Repels
, in addition to
Ultra Balls
and
Dusk Balls
.

Surf westward and climb the waterfall. Detour to the small northeast chamber to obtain an
Expert Belt
, then sail to the northwest and scale the rock wall. Inspect the lone rock for an
Ultra Ball
, and climb the waterfall to the north. Step inside the northwest chamber to find the mountain's resident legendary Pokémon.
Moltres
Moltres
, the final member of the
legendary birds
, can deal some serious damage with its
Flamethrower
and
Air Slash
moves. In addition,
AncientPower
has a slight chance of boosting each of its stats. Start off with
Water
or
Electric
attacks to quickly lower its health.
Rock-type
moves are doubly effective, but as your Pokémon are likely at higher levels, take care not to overpower it. Follow up with
Grass
-,
Fire
-,
Bug
-,
Fighting
-, and
Steel-type
moves to limit the damage it sustains. If you fail to catch it, defeat the Pokémon League once more to cause it to reappear.

Afterwards, either backtrack to the entrance or simply use an Escape Rope. Take a rest at the Pokémon Center if needed, then climb the nearest rock wall and step out onto the mountainside.
Lower Mountainside
Go south to reach an
Escape Rope
, then follow the trail up the mountainside. Pick up
TM76
(
Stealth Rock
) from the highest level, then turn north. Detour inside the nearest cave entrance to reach a
Full Restore
, then resume the trek along the narrow trail. Step inside the mid-level cave entrance to return to 1F.
1F
Follow the narrow cliff westward, then turn north. Go northeast to find a hidden
Revive
, then climb the stairway to the next chamber.
2F
This chamber houses a large crater, which forces travelers to wander in circles to reach the upper levels. Collect the
Max Elixir
,
Max Revive
, and
Calcium
, then leave through the northern exit to reach the mountain's snow-covered heights.
Upper Mountainside
Inspect the nearest group of rocks for a
Max Ether
. Head east and turn the corner; step inside the northeast cave entrance to reach a
Protein
and a hidden
Iron
, then continue south through the snow. Duck inside the next cave entrance to re-emerge on the mountain's southeast side. Head southwest and use
Rock Climb
to detour up the cliffside for a
Pure Incense
and a hidden
Rare Candy
, and enter the southeast cave.
2F
Head west and exit back into the snow.
Upper Mountainside
Scale the first cliff to reach three more areas. Climb the eastern cliffs for a hidden
Hyper Potion
, collect the
Dawn Stone
from the western cliffs, then scale the central area and enter the cave.
3F
Follow the tunnel westward and scale the enormous cliffside. Check the rock to the east for a hidden
Max Revive
. Take a moment to restore your team to full health, then exit onto the frozen mountaintop.
Summit
Cross the narrow trail to meet the strongest Trainer in
Johto
and
Kanto
,
Red
. After claiming the Champion title
three years ago
, he gave it up in order to continue his training. Because of his dedication, his is the most powerful team in the game. In order to stand a chance against him, your Pokémon will need incredible offenses, which you might want to boost with
X Attacks
or
X Specials
. Even a type advantage means little if your Pokémon are too low-leveled. Don't hesitate to switch out your Pokémon or use a
Revive
to reclaim the type advantage; after all, Red will be targeting your weaknesses too, and may switch out his own Pokémon to accomplish this.
Red leads with his
Pikachu
, which can inflict serious damage with its signature
Volt Tackle
move. The
Light Ball
it carries doubles its
Attack
and
Special Attack
; however, the item does nothing to improve its low defenses.
Electric-type
Pokémon only fear
Ground
attacks, so use moves like
Earthquake
or
Earth Power
to decimate its health.
Ground
/
Rock
Pokémon like
Graveler
and
Rhydon
should be careful of its
Iron Tail
attack. Be sure to restore your Pokémon's health as necessary to avoid a knockout due to its
Quick Attack
move.
Lapras
's
Brine
doubles in power if the target is already weakened, and
Body Slam
has a good chance of paralyzing the target.
Psychic
is mostly for Water Pokémon that resist its other attacks, though it can also deter
Fighting-type
Pokémon aiming to inflict super-effective damage. Its high
HP
makes it difficult to wear down, so try
Electric
-,
Grass
-,
Rock
-, and Fighting-type moves to take it down.
Snorlax
has a variety of strong moves, though it will likely avoid using
Shadow Ball
because of its low
Special Attack
. Conversely, its high
Attack
stat allows it to deal serious damage with
Crunch
and
Giga Impact
. Crunch may even lower the target's
Defense
, making the behemoth even more dangerous. Giga Impact is likely the biggest threat, as few Pokémon can survive the combination of 150 base power, Snorlax's high Attack stat, and the
same-type attack bonus
it receives. Like Pikachu, it is only vulnerable to moves of a single type, the
Fighting
type.
Low Kick
is especially useful, as it deals more damage to
heavier
targets.
Venusaur
takes serious damage from
Fire
-,
Ice
-,
Flying
-, and
Psychic-type
attacks.
Sleep Powder
and
Giga Drain
allows it to replenish its health while the target is incapacitated.
Sludge Bomb
is a strong move that may
poison
its opponent, but
Poison
and
Grass
moves combined have poor coverage.
Frenzy Plant
is a powerful attack that forces the user to rest on the next turn, and Venusaur's
Overgrow
Ability and Giga Drain gives it a power boost when its health is low.
Charizard
is vulnerable to
Water
,
Electric
, and especially
Rock
moves. It excels in
Special Attack
and
Speed
, which lets it wreak havoc with its powerful moves.
Air Slash
may make the target
flinch
, and
Blast Burn
deals serious damage and forces it to rest on the next turn. No combination of two types can resist both Fire- and
Dragon-type
attacks, so Charizard has great coverage with
Dragon Pulse
.
Blastoise
is afraid of only two types of moves,
Grass
and
Electric
. However, as long as it can use
Blizzard
, Grass Pokémon should avoid the battle.
Flash Cannon
and
Focus Blast
both have a chance of lowering the target's
Special Defense
, a tactic that allows the defensive Pokémon to deal more damage than usual. Like
Venusaur
's
Frenzy Plant
and
Charizard
's
Blast Burn
,
Hydro Cannon
is a powerful move that receives a
same-type attack bonus
and another power boost when its health is low, due to its
Torrent
Ability.
Many of his Pokémon know
Blizzard
to exploit the hail in Mt. Silver, which itself can be used to chip away your health, so it is recommended to attempt replacing it with another weather condition.

Defeated, he pauses for a second in stunned silence. Then in the blink of an eye, Red is gone. It is possible to battle him again, by defeating the Elite Four again and returning to the mountaintop. A moment later, the credits roll for the second time.
Afterwards, you find yourself back home in
New Bark Town
. Though the credits have rolled once more, there is still more to do. As
Professor Oak
was the one who gave you permission to scale the mountain, he will want to hear about your battle with the reclusive former Champion.
