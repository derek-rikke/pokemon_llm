Blackthorn City
Blackthorn City
Blackthorn City
is located in the northeast part of
Johto
, between the
Ice Path
and
Route 45
. It is a mysterious mountain village cut directly into the rock face. Many residents go on to become
Dragon-type
specialists, perhaps due to the proximity of the
Dragon's Den
, a large cave underneath the city. Only those with the
Gym Leader
's permission may enter this cave, by crossing the lake behind the Gym.

Time for a Trade
Visit the eastern house to find a girl who would like to trade Pokémon. She is willing to part with her
Dodrio
in exchange for a female
Dragonair
. Dragonair can only be found with a
high-end fishing rod
, but its pre-evolved form,
Dratini
, can be found in the
Dragon's Den
.
Putting in the Effort
A second girl in the easternmost house will evaluate how much effort that your lead Pokémon has put toward growing stronger. If it has maxed out its potential and earned a total of 510
EVs
, she awards the Pokémon an
Effort Ribbon
.
Move Deleter
The southern house belongs to a man known as the
Move Deleter
. Using his free service allows a Pokémon to forget one of its moves. This is especially useful for removing moves taught by
HM
, as they would normally be permanent. This can also be used to prepare a Pokémon introduced in
Generation I
to be traded through the
Time Capsule
, as any moves introduced in
Generation II
would need to be removed first.
Move Deleter and Move Tutor House
The southern house belongs to a man known as the
Move Deleter
. Using his free service allows a Pokémon to forget one of its moves. This is especially useful for removing moves taught by
HM
, as they would normally be permanent.
The house has three other residents, as well, and each of these
Move Tutors
is able to teach a certan set of moves.
The man standing near the kitchen sink is the
Pokémon Move Maniac
. In exchange for one
Heart Scale
, he can help a Pokémon relearn any move it had previously forgotten.
The elderly woman is known as
Grandma Wilma
. When shown a
Dragon-type
Pokémon that is
happy
with its Trainer, she offers to teach it the ultimate Dragon-type attack,
Draco Meteor
.
The elderly man is able evaluate any fully-evolved
first partner Pokémon
. If it is
happy
with its Trainer, he offers to teach it the ultimate move of its type:
Frenzy Plant
,
Blast Burn
, or
Hydro Cannon
.

Blackthorn City Pokémon Gym
Leader: Clair
The Blessed User of Dragon Pokémon
The
Blackthorn Gym
specializes in
Dragon-type
Pokémon. Dragon-type moves are super effective against Dragon-type Pokémon, while Dragon-type Pokémon are weak to Dragon- and
Ice-type
moves.
Shortly after entering the building, the
Gym guide
warns that the building's flooring is unstable and that Pokémon must be kept in their Poké Balls. The Gym features two stationary platforms lined with spikes, and three smaller stone platforms. Each of these has a blue button that rotates the platform, and two arrow buttons that move it in the respective direction. Challengers must use these buttons to direct these stone platforms across the lava and advance to the
Gym Leader
.

Clair
leads with her
Gyarados
, a
Water
/
Flying
Pokémon. Due to this typing, it sustains massive damage when hit by
Electric-type
attacks. Her two Dragonair have nearly identical movesets, except for a single attack. Having access to
Fire Blast
and
Aqua Tail
gives Clair an advantage when facing two of
Professor Elm
's three Pokémon. As a part-
Water
Pokémon, her Kingdra takes serious damage only from
Dragon-type
attacks. Bring
Paralysis
-healing items, and use
HP
-restoring items often to keep from being caught off-guard by Kingdra's
Hyper Beam
.

After the battle,
Clair
is left in disbelief. She admits that she lost, but claims that you are still not ready for the Pokémon League, and insists that you take the "Dragon-master challenge". She informs you of the
Dragon's Den
, a large cave located under the city, and instructs you to visit the shrine found inside. Doing so proves your worth, and only then will she give up the Rising Badge. Bring a Pokémon with
Surf
and
Whirlpool
, and cross the lake to reach the cave entrance behind the Gym.
Dragon's Den
Dragon's Den
Inside the shrine
The
Dragon's Den
is a large cavern located underneath
Blackthorn City
. It is a sacred home of
Dragon-type
Pokémon, and where the city's residents train to become Dragon-type specialists. A large shrine is located on a platform to the south.

. Backtrack and enter the shrine.
Dragon Shrine
The Trial
When you enter the shrine, you are met by the clan's
elder
. He realizes that you were sent by
Clair
, and explains that you must pass a quiz to determine your perception of Pokémon.
Question
Answers
What are Pokémon to you?
Ally
Junior
Friend
What helps you to win battles?
Strategy
Training
Cheating
What kind of Trainer do you wish to battle?
Weak
Strong
Anyone
What is most important for raising Pokémon?
Love
Violence
Knowledge
Strong Pokémon. Weak Pokémon. Which is more important?
Strength
Both
Weakness
Correct answers are marked in
bold
.
The elder reviews your answers, and determines that you care deeply for Pokémon. He stresses the importance of never losing that conviction, as it will assist you at the Pokémon League.
Clair
enters a moment later, assuming that you have failed. She is shocked to learn that you passed the elder's test, as even she has not done so. The elder scolds her, telling her to admit defeat and award the
Rising Badge
, or else he will inform
Lance
of her behavior. She reluctantly complies; this Badge ensures obedience from all Pokémon and enables the use of
Waterfall
in the field. Shen then leaves the shrine without a word. The elder then mentions the
Whirl Islands
, and how a Pokémon named
Lugia
is said to live there.
Clair
is waiting for you near the north end of the broken bridge. She apologizes for her behavior, and gives out
TM59
(
Dragon Pulse
) as a prize. Now that you have earned all eight Badges in the
Johto
region, Clair tells you that your next step will be the Pokémon League at
Indigo Plateau
. She advises you to
Surf
east from
New Bark Town
, but mentions how the look on your face says that you have unfinished business. She warns you not to give up, regardless of what challenges lie ahead, or she will feel even worse for having lost to you.
The Prize
Having passed the elder's trial, you may return at any point with no more than five Pokémon in your party. Speak to the elder, and he entrusts you with a
Dratini
as proof that he has recognized your worth. If every question was answered correctly, the Pokémon will know a special move,
ExtremeSpeed
, that it cannot otherwise learn. If not, it will know the move
Leer
instead.
Elm's Request
Upon leaving the cave,
Professor Elm
calls to ask that you visit him at the Lab, as he has something for you.
Route 45
Route 45
Route 45
is a rugged road leading down from the mountains around
Blackthorn City
. The path splits and recombines multiple times, and the uneven terrain makes northbound travel impossible; this also forces travelers to visit multiple times to reach every area. The eastern entrance to
Dark Cave
is located on the north end of the route. The path eventually turns west at a small pond, where it connects to
Route 46
.
