You'll be at the desk in your room upstairs at your house. Once you get up and walk around a bit you'll be able to change any settings with the X button and selecting "Options." After this, head downstairs. Your
mom's
Skwovet
will meet you at the bottom of the stairs. Head left into the kitchen and your mom will greet you. Here, you'll learn that you will be enrolling in
Naranja Academy
S
/
Uva Academy
V
. Shortly after the conversation, the doorbell will ring. Head towards the door and you'll be greeted by Mr. Clavell, the Academy Director, who immediately refers to you as
"Master"
/
"Miss"
. He is there to deliver your enrollment documents. Your mom offers him a cup of tea while instructing you to go upstairs to your room to grab your bag and hat. You'll immediately have your
Adventure Guide
with you, which will give you some helpful tips as you adventure through the Paldea region.
As soon as you go back downstairs, Clavell will ask you to meet him outside so you can choose your
first partner Pokémon
:
Sprigatito
,
Fuecoco
, and
Quaxly
. You won't need to decide right away, as you'll be allowed to roam around with them for a short amount of time.

As you prepare to leave, your mom will give you a
Rotom Phone
. The first partner Pokémon will continue to follow you as you head around
Cabo Poco
. You are tasked with taking the first partner Pokémon on a walk, then meeting Director Clavell at the house down the way. Go to the right side of your house and pick up an
Antidote
inside the vegetable garden. Go around to the back of the house and pick up a
Potion
. Go along the path on the west side to pick up a
Poké Ball
.
Director Clavell's mansion and Nemona
Make your way down to the house in Cabo Poco. Enter the gates of the house and you'll be greeted by Clavell and your new rival,
Nemona
. Nemona is another student who attends the Academy. She will offer to show you around, giving you hints and information. She'll also want to battle you at every opportunity, so be prepared. Before that, though, it's finally time to pick your first partner Pokémon:
Being a
Grass-type
,
Sprigatito
is vulnerable to
Fire
,
Flying
,
Bug
,
Poison
, and
Ice-type
moves. Its line prefers
Attack
and
Speed
stats, combined with a somewhat decent
Defense
stat, that makes it an excellent swift grass-type. Upon evolution into
Meowscarada
, it gains a
Dark type
, which adds more weaknesses; however, Meowscarada's Speed and Attack stats can make up for its low defensive capabilities.
The
Fire-type
Fuecoco
line boasts high
HP
and high
Special Attack
, but a slow
Speed
could be a monkey wrench in its tactics. It has a diverse movepool which lends itself well to its role in battle as a physical sweeper. Its fire typing makes it vulnerable to
Water
,
Ground
, and
Rock
-type moves, but after evolution into half-
Ghost
Skeledirge
, it gains a protection against
Normal
and
Fighting
-type moves.
As a representative of
Water-type
types,
Quaxly
prefers physical
Attacks
, but its low
HP
and
Defense
could pose a problem. As a
Water-type
-type, its not very good against
Grass
and
Electric
-types. Upon evolving into
Quaquaval
, its strength is increased, giving it
STAB
on
Fighting-type
attacks.
When you decided to choose your own first partner, Nemona will choose a one with
type
disadvantage. And after that, she'll challenge you to a battle down by the beach and she says she'll be ready waiting for when you are.
Before you head off to the beach, feel free to explore and collect a few more items. Go west to the back of the house by the palm tree to collect a
Potion
. Go south of here and you'll be able to grab an
Antidote
to the right. In the distance you'll be able to find another
Potion
. Go down to the beach, and instead of immediately battling Nemona, go south near the water's edge to pick up a
Poké Ball
. Go back towards Nemona to the west. There is a dead end where you can find another
Poké Ball
.
When you're ready, go back and speak with Nemona to initiate your first battle. Clavell will arrive and stop her from using her experienced Pokémon and she will decide to use her first partner Pokémon instead.

After the battle, she will be quite eager to battle again; however, Clavell will intervene saying you've had enough for today. After the discussion, you'll receive the
Pokédex
on your Rotom Phone from Nemona. Clavell with then task Nemona with seeing you to the Academy, and will decide to watch over the other first partner Pokémon not chosen.
Nemona will then want to show us how to catch wild Pokémon. Go west and out of the gates by her house where you'll bump into her talking to your mom. She will give you a
Sandwich
and five
Potions
. Your mom will then return home, and Nemona will head to
Poco Path
. Follow the trail to the north to catch up to her.
