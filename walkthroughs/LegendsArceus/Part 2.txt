Jubilife Village
The player putting on their Survey Corps outfit
Galaxy Hall, the headquarters of the Galaxy Team
You return to
Jubilife Village
, unscathed. On the way back,
Rei
/
Akari
mentions that you can carry up to six Pokémon in your party at one time, and eventually you can keep the rest in the village
pastures
(the equivalent of the
PC
for storing Pokémon, in other Pokémon games).
Professor Laventon
suggests that you report to
Cyllene
as soon as possible.
Walk north and enter
Galaxy Hall
. Continue into Cyllene's office directly in front of you, and approach her desk. Upon your arrival, Cyllene is impressed. She gave you a tall order because you're an outsider, and yet you exceeded her expectations. She allows you to keep your satchel, hands you a Survey Corps Uniform and Sandals, and orders you to report to the commander once you get changed.
Go outside of Galaxy Hall, and turn west to return to your room. Once inside, head to the back corner with the futon, and press
A
on the mirror on the wall to change your outfit. Press
L
or
R
to navigate the menus and press
A
to put on your Survey Corps Uniform and your Survey Corps Sandals. Press
B
when you're finished.
When you finish changing, you head back to the Galaxy Hall and Rei/Akari complements how the outfit fits you. Cyllene comes downstairs, saying that you may continue to live in the same room while you work in the Survey Corps. She finally gives you a hat to tie the outfit all together, and orders you to meet with the Commander on the third floor.
Commander Kamado, the Commander of the Galaxy Team
Commander of the Galaxy Team
Head up either stairway to the second floor, and then turn around to go up another flight of stairs.
At the top of the stairs, you meet Commander
Kamado
, the commander of the
Galaxy Team
, who introduces himself and is aware of the rift that you came from. All of a sudden, he challenges you to physically fight him! You charge at him, but he easily sumo throws you, a tiny 15-year-old child, to the floor. He warns that not everyone in the village will be kind to outsiders, but acknowledges that you completed the trial and are now a proper member of the Survey Corps and Jubilife Village. He orders you to complete the Pokédex and to stay vigilant, as Pokémon are dangerous creatures.
You've completed
The Galaxy Corps Entry Trial
!
You return to Cyllene's office, and she explains that you're beginning as a No Star recruit, meaning you currently have no rank. To gain a better rank, Laventon adds, you must add more information to the Pokédex. To do that, you'll need Poké Balls, so Cyllene hands you a recipe to
craft
your own Poké Balls and
$
3,000 to buy the materials you'll need. She orders Rei/Akari to teach you how to craft, and you receive a mission:

The crafting interface
The Basics of Crafting
Head outside of Galaxy Hall.
Anthe
, the local clothier approaches you, and says that the Professor asked her to give you a change of clothes. She hands you an Everyday Kimono and a pair of Everyday Trousers, and hopes you take a look at the village shops eventually. (You can talk to her or use the mirror in your room to equip the outfit, if you'd like.) Rei/Akari waves at you and shouts to follow them to the
craftworks
.
Follow Rei/Akari to the craftworks in the east. They explain, to craft, you just need to use the workbench and have the necessary materials and recipes. They hand you the materials for a Poké Ball for free and tell you to spend the money on other things you might need.
Walk up to the crafting bench and press
A
to pull up the list of recipes. Press
A
again to select a recipe, and use the
D-pad
to select how many Poké Balls you'd like to craft. When you've decided, press
A
to craft.
You've completed
The Basics of Crafting
!
Laventon approaches again to remind you how Poké Balls make use of a Pokémon's ability to shrink down to capture them. Then, he hands you a Pokédex. Rei/Akari explain that you need to complete research tasks to fill the Pokédex, and you receive a mission:

Accepting requests
Guardsman Beauregard in front of Galaxy Hall
You walk away from the bench, ready to get back to work, but before you can leave, a guardsman in front of Galaxy Hall speaks up. He had overheard that you're heading to the Fieldlands Camp, and gives you your first
request
. Requests aren't required to beat the game, but you can earn various rewards for completing them. Townspeople that have requests will display a request icon above them, and this icon also shows up on the Arc Phone map.
If you'd like, talk to guardsman Beauregard to receive Request 1:
Wurmple Can Evolve
.
From now on, available requests will be shown in each section, but won't be covered in detail. Head to
Requests: Part 1
for a detailed walkthrough on requests, as this section focuses on the main storyline and
missions
.
You also have gained access to a variety of shops and services throughout Jubilife Village: you can buy general trainer items at the
general store
, you just learned about the
craftworks
where you can buy materials to craft with, you can grow useful crops at the
farm
, and you can buy powerful buff charms at the
folk shrine
at the farthest northwest corner. All of these shops may not offer amazing items right now, but they'll provide significantly more useful items as you progress.
When you're ready, head back to the front gate (the same one that you first departed Jubilife Village from) and head to the
Obsidian Fieldlands
.

Beauregard will refuse to accept

↑
Dorian requests a height of 2'8" or larger; however
due to an oversight
, he will accept some 2'7" Buizel. Height is stored internally as a value from 0-255, and Dorian accepts Buizel from size 215-255.
The height of 2'7" ranges from 196-217, which slightly overlaps the accepted range, meaning he'll erroneously accept 3/22 possible Buizel with a height of 2'7".
Obsidian Fieldlands
Starly's research tasks for its Pokédex entry
Map of Obsidian Fieldlands
Now that you're an actual member of the Survey Corps, it's finally time to get down to business and begin seeking out the Pokémon. When you arrive in the
Obsidian Fieldlands
, Laventon explains that you'll need to study the Pokémon in depth to begin writing its Pokédex entry.
The Pokédex
Unlike other Pokémon games, simply catching one Pokémon isn't enough complete its entry. Instead, you need to fulfill
research tasks
, to study the Pokémon's behaviors and habits. These include objectives like catching or battling multiple of the Pokémon, evolving the Pokémon, seeing them use certain moves, etc. There has never been an actual complete Pokédex before, so you're starting from scratch and you need as much data as you can collect.
You can press
Down
on the
D-pad
to open up the Pokédex. Each Pokémon's entry has different research tasks to complete. To complete a Pokédex entry, you need to finish 10 research tasks (you can think of it as 10 check marks). You should focus on the ones with the red arrows next to them, as they give double points, which make completing the entry faster. You could hypothetically complete a Pokédex entry with only 5 research tasks. There's also diminishing returns: the requirements increase for the same task, so it's much faster to do many different tasks than to only stick to one.
Head to Aspiration Hill
At this point, the game is much more open. You actually won't be able to progress unless you explore, so feel free to take your time, collect items, fill Pokédex entries, and most importantly catch Pokémon.
Rei/Akari also gives you a tip for self-defense: how to dodge. You can dodge by pressing
Y
for a brief window of invincibility and movement. Also unlike other Pokémon games, the Pokémon will openly attack
you
, the player. If you get too hurt, you may
black out
and lose many of the items in your satchel. Rei/Akari reminds you that the day before,
they
were attacked by
Shinx
and had to be rescued—not just their Pokémon. You should make use of dodging and dashing to maneuver out of tough situations and to prevent the same thing from happening to you.
Follow Rei/Akari onto
Aspiration Hill
. They explain that if you target a Pokémon with
ZL
, you can press
Down
on the
D-pad
to quickly access the Pokédex entry for that Pokémon. It's a useful shortcut that makes it so that you don't need to search for the correct Pokédex entry manually. They also begin showing you examples of common research tasks: for instance, one of
Bidoof
's research tasks is to catch multiple of them.
Follow Rei/Akari down the path and into the tall grass in the west. One of
Starly
's research tasks is to catch it without being spotted.

All of these items replenish regularly.

Horseshoe Plains
Head to Horseshoe Plains
Go down the Aspiration Hill path all the way until the bridge, where you had first caught Shinx. Then, follow Rei/Akari westward to the
Horseshoe Plains
. They point out
Buizel
, who is similarly aggressive to Shinx: you must battle it to have a chance to catch it. One of its research tasks is to see it use a specific attack in battle (in this case,
Aqua Jet
).
Follow Rei/Akari deeper into Horseshoe Plains. For keeping up with them, they give you your own
Crafting Kit
, which lets you craft anywhere using items from your satchel. (Your satchel has limited inventory space—if you want to craft using
all
your items, you should use a workbench.) They also give you a crafting recipe for
Potions
.
They also explain that the cover page of the Pokédex shows your current progress: how many Pokémon you've seen, how many you've caught, how many research tasks you've completed, etc. Then, they ask you to report back to Professor Laventon when you're finished. For now, don't worry about that yet and continue exploring.

Some of the Pokémon marked with (‡) may only spawn near the area's borders.
The cover of the Pokédex, which displays your progress
Getting to Work on Research Tasks
If you'll notice, the mission description may read, "Report your research tasks to Professor Laventon and earn a sufficient number of Pokémon
research points
." To progress and rank up in the Survey Corps, you must earn a total of 500 research points (you can see how many you currently have and need at the bottom of the Pokédex's cover).
One research task gives 10 points, the research tasks with the red arrows give 20 points, and completing a Pokédex entry gives an additional 100 points. So,
completing one entry gives a total of 200 points
. With the sheer amount of new Pokémon around, and the research points you likely already have, it shouldn't take too long to earn enough to progress.
Here's some tips for catching Pokémon:
Aim for the Pokémon's back when throwing Poké Balls to increase the chance of catching it (i.e.
catch rate
), while it's distracted or doesn't see you. This is called a back strike.
You can also do the same when throwing a Pokémon out to initiate a battle, and the wild Pokémon will be stunned for a turn.
You can throw
Berries
to distract the Pokémon if it doesn't see you or is friendly, which increases its catch rate as it eats. Make sure you crouch as you approach the Pokémon.
If the Pokémon is actively trying to attack you, you can instead throw
Spoiled Apricorns
or
Balls of Mud
to stun it and increase its catch rate.
The basic red Poké Ball doesn't have a high catch rate, so don't be discouraged if they break out, even with these tips. You can always lower their HP in battle, the old-fashioned way.
Now that much more of the map is available for you to explore, get to work on completing those research tasks in any order you'd like. You could start with the four you already have (your
first partner Pokémon
, Bidoof, Starly, and Shinx) or you could go around catching new species of Pokémon. This is also a good opportunity to catch a
Wurmple
, a large Buizel, and to fill Starly's Pokédex entry for the requests.
You should also level your Pokémon up to at least 9 for an upcoming battle.

New areas to explore (Optional)
This section is incomplete.
Please feel free to edit this section to add missing information and complete it.
Reason: Floaro Gardens item list
In addition to
Aspiration Hill
and
Horseshoe Plains
, you can also explore
Floaro Gardens
,
Sandgem Flats
, and part of
Lake Verity
, but you should definitely keep it to those first three areas for now. As you'll see in the encounter tables below, Sandgem Flats and Lake Verity have significantly higher-level Pokémon, many of which are aggressive and difficult to capture. It's extremely risky to explore those areas at your current level. There is also a guardsman on the bridge on Aspiration Hill that prevents you from crossing until you rank up, locking off your access to the rest of the Obsidian Fieldlands.

You can always visit these areas later, when you and your Pokémon are stronger. Also, if you want to keep exploring,
don't report to Professor Laventon yet
. As soon as you talk to him after earning enough research points, he'll immediately take you back to Jubilife Village.
When you're ready, return back to Professor Laventon at the Fieldlands Camp. Professor Laventon records your research tasks and caught Pokémon in a survey report to keep track of your progress. He also gives you money and research points relative to the amount of work that you do. Now that you've made significant progress on the Pokédex, Laventon suggests that you talk to Cyllene to rank up in the Survey Corps, and you head back to
Jubilife Village
