The player receiving their first star
Head north into

, and go into
Cyllene
's office. Press
A
to show Cyllene your Pokédex.
You've become a
First Star recruit
!
Gaining a higher
rank
grants you many benefits. For example, as a First Star recruit, you can use a new type of Poké Ball called a
Heavy Ball
and Pokémon up to level 20 will obey you in battle. You'll also earn more money from survey reports. Cyllene commends you for your hard work and hopes that you continue to keep at it. She hands you recipes for Heavy Balls and
Revives
, then suggests that you rest for the night.
You eat dinner at The Wallflower with
Rei
/
Akari
and
Professor Laventon
, who congratulate you on receiving your first star. Rei/Akari brings up requests and how they can come from anywhere, even outside of Jubilife Village. For example, Rei/Akari wants you to help them with a request from
Mai
of the
Diamond Clan
because it requires skill in battling.

The next day, Rei/Akari shows up at your door, asking if you have time to help them out. They suggest that you head to the

in the east end of the village to change the Pokémon in your party.
When you're ready, head north to the
training grounds
, and press
A
to talk to Rei/Akari. They admit to having a partner Pokémon, a
Pikachu
, but can't quite command it in battle as easily as you can. So, they challenge you to a Pokémon battle to train them!

An example of the symbols next to each move
After defeating Rei/Akari in battle, they felt like they understood Pikachu for once and were in sync. They strive to be as connected as you are with your Pokémon.
Rei/Akari also mentions that they had heard the Professor mention something called
Types
, which are attributes that effect what a Pokémon's strengths or weaknesses are. Types are extremely important in Pokémon, as they can double, halve, or even negate the damage of an attack, so definitely keep them in mind.
When selecting a move, there will be several icons in the move's interface. On the far left is the icon of the move's type. On the far right is its
effectiveness
, the strength of the move against an enemy Pokémon's types. If it's a small dot, it's neutral damage (1x). If it's a circle, that means it's super effective (2x). If it's a triangle, that's not very effective (1/2x). If it's a cross or an X, that means it doesn't effect them (0x). These symbols make it so that you don't always have to always worry about what types the enemy Pokémon is weak to. Otherwise, you can use a
type chart
.
Zisu, the Captain of the Security Corps
Captain of the Security Corps
Types
The entire time,
Zisu
, the captain of the
Security Corps
, was watching the battle and approaches. She is the local master of Pokémon battling and she gives you some tips.
Firstly, she mentions that in battle, you can
change the properties of a move
by using either
agile style
or
strong style
. Agile style makes it so that your Pokémon moves faster in the
action order
(and can possibly go twice in a row) but weakens the move's power. Strong style is the opposite, making your Pokémon move slower in the action order but making the attack do much more damage. Either style is a temporary one-turn buff that uses more
power points
.
You can apply one of the styles by pressing
L
or
R
when selecting the move in battle.
You may not see the option to select a style, but don't worry; a Pokémon slowly gains the ability to use styles on certain moves as they level up. (For example, the above image has the style option for
Iron Head
, but not for
Double-Edge
.) Eventually, you can also use certain items to enable your Pokémon to be able to use styles on more moves.
Zisu also mentions that at any time, you can ask her to
teach your Pokémon new moves
for a small fee. Definitely make use of this, as she can give your Pokémon many of their most powerful moves.
Rei/Akari remind you that they asked for your help with the request from Mai last night—it's about time that they meet up with her on
Aspiration Hill
. You receive a new mission:
A Request from Mai
.
Go ahead and make any preparations you need to make, then head to the east gate to depart for the
Obsidian Fieldlands
.
Obsidian Fieldlands
Volo, spooking the player from behind
Mai, one of the wardens of the Diamond Clan
You return to the
Fieldlands Camp
, when suddenly... you get spooked by
Volo
from behind! He teaches you about the back strike technique, which increases a Pokémon's catch rate (when throwing a Poké Ball) or stuns it (when sending your Pokémon out for battle). He wishes you well and heads off.
You can speak with Professor Laventon to return to Jubilife Village at any point, and when you earn enough research points, you can talk to Cyllene to increase your rank.
You should take a rest in the tent to heal your Pokémon. When you're ready, head down Aspiration Hill and talk to the guardsman on the bridge. Now that you're a First Star rank recruit, he lets you pass and tells you to not let your guard down.

From
Mai
, after defeating her at the bridge
LA
Then, Mai asks you if you know what the almighty Sinnoh is. The Diamond Clan settled in Hisui to worship the almighty Sinnoh, the creator of time, the world, and the Pokémon that live in it. It's an old tale, and almighty Sinnoh has long since ceased direct contact with most people. However, it still has connections with a few Pokémon, and it's the warden's job to look after them. One of them is currently causing trouble at
Deertrack Heights
, so Mai wants you to meet her there to learn more.
The possible areas that a First Star recruit can explore
New areas to explore (Optional)
This section is incomplete.
Please feel free to edit this section to add missing information and complete it.
Reason: Each area's item lists
Now that you've crossed the bridge, you have access to nearly the entire map of Obsidian Fieldlands (besides a few islands that you can't reach quite yet). The first five areas you could access before were Aspiration Hill, Horseshoe Plains, Floaro Gardens, Sandgem Flats, and part of Lake Verity. You can refer to
this part of the walkthrough
for the available items and Pokémon for those areas.
After crossing the bridge, you can reach
Grueling Grove
,
Worn Bridge
,
Windswept Run
,
Nature's Pantry
,
Tidewater Dam
,
The Heartwood
,
Grandtree Arena
,
Oreburrow Tunnel
, and
Obsidian Falls
. If you're trying to find Oreburrow Tunnel, you can throw your Pokémon at a crack in the wall and it'll clear a path for you. You can enter either from the south end of Grueling Grove or the east side of The Heartwood.
The next two story-related areas,

Approach Mai at the top of the stairs. Professor Laventon arrives panting, after sprinting all the way from the Fieldlands Camp. He wanted to see the
alpha Pokémon
for himself, and Mai allows it. Mai explains the situation: she wanted to pay tribute to a Pokémon that is related to almighty Sinnoh, but instead, she's interrupted by the cry of an alpha
Kricketune
that's been causing trouble. Mai heals your Pokémon, and wishes you luck with taking it on. Laventon ponders about its size, and Mai explains that alphas are significantly larger and stronger than normal Pokémon.
Approach the Kricketune to battle it (you don't need to throw out a Pokémon). You can catch most of the static encounters in this game, and the game will let you know if you are unable to.
Bug types like Kricketune are weak to

In battle, you can press
Y
to show the
action order
, which shows the order that Pokémon will be taking turns and how often. This is based on factors like their
Speed
, whether you're using
agile or strong style
, etc.
Once you've taken out the alpha Kricketune, Mai heals your party again, as a different Pokémon cries out. Up on the cliff is the great
Wyrdeer
! It jumps down to get a better look, and takes a liking to you. When it leaves, Mai explains that it lets people
ride
on it if it deems them worthy. Rei/Akari appears, sent by Cyllene. They explain that after subduing the alpha Pokémon, they can set up another camp site at this location. Laventon shows concern if it's okay to do this, but Mai reassures him that it's alright as long as you coexist and thrive with the Pokémon. Mai leaves to report back to her superior, and promises to give you a reward when she can.
