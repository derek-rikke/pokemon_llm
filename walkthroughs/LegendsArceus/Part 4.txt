The Frenzy of the Lord of the Woods
Jubilife Village
You return to The Wallflower for the evening, and
Professor Laventon
orders potato mochi. When
Beni
returns with the food, he reports some grave news—a frenzied
Kleavor
has attacked many of the Survey Corps team that tried to investigate it. Laventon heard that it had been struck by powerful lightning which caused its behavior, and supposes that there's always a risk of danger for the Survey Corps. Rei/Akari add that even
alpha Pokémon
don't stand a chance to its power. Laventon suggests that you rest for the night.
The next day, Rei/Akari greet you in the morning, and tell you to hurry to the commander's office.

Summoned by Commander Kamado
Adaman, the leader of the Diamond Clan
Irida, the leader of the Pearl Clan
Exit your room. When you're about to leave, you're interrupted by a couple of loud voices arguing about the almighty Sinnoh. One argues that it was the creator of time, while the other argues that it was the creator of space. They angrily storm off to Commander
Kamado
's office. Rei/Akari explain that they were
Adaman
and
Irida
, the leader of the
Diamond Clan
and
Pearl Clan
, respectively.
Head inside
Galaxy Hall
and head up to the third floor to reach Commander Kamado's office. When you approach, you overhear Adaman immediately get to the point: the Pearl clan's frenzied
Kleavor
is causing a lot of harm, but the Diamond clan can't step in or else they run the risk of reigniting war between the clans. Irida adds that the Pearl clan doesn't want to have to take down one of their own. Kamado acknowledges your presence, and the two leaders kindly introduce themselves, as though they weren't just arguing a few seconds ago.
Kamado proposes a plan: he wants you, as a third party, to observe and study Kleavor before they commit to any decisions. Adaman and Irida agree reluctantly, and comment on the
Galaxy Team
's use of Poké Balls. Kamado reassures them that Poké Balls are not for controlling Pokémon, but for working alongside them, and gives you your order to study Kleavor. You receive a new mission:
The Frenzy of the Lord of the Woods
. Adaman and Irida wish you luck on your mission and depart. Kamado explains that the Galaxy Expedition Team are the outsiders of Hisui, while the Diamond and Pearl clans are the natives—you must not do anything to ruin the relationships between them.
Cyllene
comes upstairs and calls you to her office to discuss the details of the mission.
Where to begin the investigation
Head back down to the first floor and approach Cyllene's desk. Professor Laventon also appears to explain the situation. The Survey Corps are currently unable to catch Kleavor, and has been proving to be extremely aggressive. Cyllene clarifies: the mission is extremely dangerous. She continues: the Diamond and Pearl Clans believe that there are powerful Pokémon related to almighty Sinnoh, called
noble Pokémon
, which they worship and give offerings to. Kleavor is one of the Pearl Clan's nobles.
As a possible lead, Laventon begins to suggest that perhaps you could start by figuring out what their offerings are... when suddenly, Mai and Adaman burst into the office. Adaman explains that by traveling through the space-time rift, you may have met the almighty Sinnoh itself, and so he wants you to quell Kleavor's frenzy completely. He explains that the Diamond clan is facing their own similar problem, but he wants to help the Pearl clan as best as he can. Mai explains that you can find Kleavor at Grandtree Arena, and his warden is a boy named
Lian
. As soon as they're finished explaining, they immediately leave. Rei/Akari suggests that you set off from the Height Camp to reach Grandtree Arena, and get ready to head out.
Approach the exit of Galaxy Hall. Before you can leave, a guardsman named Bagin interrupts you. He can give you an extra slot in your satchel for a fee—however, you'll quickly notice that his prices become
significantly more expensive per slot
.
Exit Galaxy Hall, and head to the east gate. When you approach the gate to depart, Volo appears and hands you some
Super Potions
, then leaves to search for some ruins.
When you're ready, prepare to leave for the Heights Camp in the
Obsidian Fieldlands
.

Grandtree Arena
Depart for the Heights Camp, and make your way into the southeast corner of the map.
Head to Grandtree Arena
The person you're searching for is located in
Grandtree Arena
, the deepest part of
The Heartwood
. The easiest route to get there is south through
Nature's Pantry
, through
Tidewater Dam
, and then east into
The Heartwood
. (Refer to
this part of the walkthrough
for the available items and Pokémon in those areas.)
From there, continue deeper into the woods and look for two orange signs. Approach the boy in the back of the woods.
Warden of the noble Kleavor
Lian, one of the wardens of the Pearl Clan
The boy introduces himself as
Lian
, the Pearl Clan's warden of Kleavor. He's been instructed by Irida to turn anyone away because it's much too dangerous to approach Kleavor with its current behavior.
If you want to continue pursuing Kleavor, you'll have to get through him and his partner Pokémon,
Goomy
, first. Face him in battle!
Dragon-type
Pokémon, like Goomy, are weak to
Ice
,
Dragon
, and
Fairy-type
attacks. Dragon-types also have many resistances. However, Goomy's only attacking moves are
Bubble
and
Acid Spray
, both of which are not very powerful, so this shouldn't be a difficult fight.

After defeating him, he still suggests that you leave because it's too dangerous. He'd normally give Kleavor an offering of his favorite food, but it's too aggressive to accept any offerings at all. Then, Irida appears, and convinces Lian that even though the Pearl Clan would rather solve this themselves, it would be best for everyone to let the outsider handle it. Irida and Lian plan to get Kleavor's favorite foods as an offering, and Irida orders you to find a way to quell its frenzy.
You can

by opening your Arc Phone with
Minus

X
. Then, select a camp to travel to. (Alternatively, you can do the same thing by moving the cursor with the

Return to either camp and report back to Professor Laventon. When you approach, you let him know what occurred at Grandtree Arena and the two of you return to
Jubilife Village
.
Jubilife Village (Revisited)
The moment that Professor Laventon realizes the solution
You head to Professor Laventon's lab in Galaxy Hall, and he ponders on how best to use the food to calm down Kleavor. It's impossible to approach it to offer it food in its aggressive state. Laventon goes silent for a while... until it hits him: you should
throw the food at him like Poké Balls
! You should return to Grandtree Arena to let Irida and Lian know about the plan.
Exit Galaxy Hall, and approach the east gate. Mai says that there's some news, and you set out for the Heights Camp in the
Obsidian Fieldlands
.

The player calling Wyrdeer with a Celestica Flute
Mai takes you to the Heights camp to meet with Adaman... and
Wyrdeer
! Adaman's been telling Wyrdeer about how much you've been working to find a way to calm down Kleavor, and it believes you are worthy! Adaman orders Mai to take out a white flute, and she plays a mysterious melody. Adaman explains that it's a
Celestica Flute
, which is used to call Wyrdeer to ride him. He hands you your own flute to see if you can do the same. You try to play the melody and... Wyrdeer accepts it! Wyrdeer opens its heart and hands you a
Mind Plate
.
You can now ride Wyrdeer! You can summon a

by pressing

The frenzied noble Kleavor
Lian begins a prayer to call Kleavor to give it offerings. Irida suggests you make use of dodging to avoid Kleavor's attacks, but she is interrupted by a Pokémon's loud cry—the very same that you heard when the lightning first struck. You wonder where it came from, until you see a giant golden figure, running at impeccable speed for its size. It slices through a tree like butter, as you can clearly see that it has two axes for arms. It lands in front of you before the tree even finishes falling, and you finally get a good look at the creature: it is indeed the frenzied
noble
Kleavor
.
The Frenzy of the Lord of the Woods
To quell a noble Pokémon's frenzy, you must throw
balms
with
ZR
to reduce its frenzy gauge, the yellow meter at the stop of the screen. If you manage to find an opening and the screen reads, "
Send in a Pokémon, and do battle!
", you can do so and enter battle. If you defeat it, the noble becomes stunned and gives you an opportunity throw a lot of balms.
Kleavor will stand and charge an attack, facing you. Its eye will shine when it's ready, and then it will charge you in a straight line. To get an opening, you want to dodge at the last moment and bait it into crashing into a wall.
Kleavor is
Bug
/
Rock-type
. Kleavor's weaknesses are
Rock
,
Steel
, and
Water-type
attacks. A Pokémon with multiple types combines each type's weaknesses and resistances, adding additional ones or cancelling them out.

The explosion to quell Kleavor's frenzy
The normal noble Kleavor
Once you empty its frenzy gauge completely, you throw one final balm at Kleavor. It explodes in an extremely brilliant light, much like when you first met
Arceus
, and the aggressive golden sheen that once covered Kleavor disappears. Now that it's relaxed, Kleavor hands you an
Insect Plate
and runs off.
Lian and Irida appear, completely puzzled by the light. They ponder about the mysterious bolt of lightning that first sent Kleavor into a frenzy, and if it could have been almighty Sinnoh's power. Lian wonders whether it was even the right thing to try and stop it. However, Irida reassures him that almighty Sinnoh would not have one of its Pokémon attack the innocent people that worship it. The two of them thank you for what you've done. Irida hands you 3
Sitrus Berries
and heals your Pokémon as a reward, and she wants you to keep aiding any other frenzied Pokémon that may be in a similar situation.
Return to either camp and speak with Professor Laventon to finally return to
Jubilife Village
and report to commander
Kamado
