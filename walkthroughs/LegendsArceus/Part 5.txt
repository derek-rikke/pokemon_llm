Jubilife Village
The player using a Smoke Bomb to hide from a Luxio
You return to
Jubilife Village
, as
Volo
greets you at the
front gate
. He saw a light in the sky and came out, hoping that you quelled the
noble
Kleavor
! He gets a glimpse of the two plates you've received, the
Mind Plate
and the
Insect Plate
. A mysterious message is written on them that states, "Where all creation was born, that is the being's place of origin." You explain to him that you received them from Kleavor and
Wyrdeer
. He wants you to continue getting more plates to read, and excitedly sets off.
Head to
Galaxy Hall
and go up to
Kamado
's office. Kamado heard what happened with Kleavor and congratulates you on your work, as the people of
Hisui
have one less thing to worry about. However, there are more nobles that are similarly in a frenzy, and he orders you to continue investigating. But for now, you are dismissed and can take a rest at the
Wallflower
.
You've completed
The Frenzied Lord of the Woods
!
You return to the Wallflower.
Beni
brings you more potato mochi, and he mentions that word gets around the village quick: quelling Kleavor's frenzy has given you quite the reputation. Rei/Akari and Laventon praise you for making the Obsidian Fieldlands safer, and Rei/Akari gives you a recipe for
Smoke Bombs
. You can use them as temporary cover that you can sneak in, much like tall grass. Laventon wants you to continue filling the Pokédex, and you all dig in to the potato mochi.

Eerie Apparitions in the Night
Vessa near the pastures
After you eat, you head off to
your quarters
. Before you enter, a child in a brown outfit calls your name and urges you to follow her. She takes you to a bridge near the
pastures
and introduces herself as
Vessa
. A calamity that was once sealed away has started to break out, and its seal is broken. She asks you to restore the seal and she gives you an
Odd Keystone
. In order to restore the seal, you must collect ghostly purple
wisps
into the Odd Keystone. Vessa points to one that's nearby, and asks you to collect it.
Cross the bridge and press
A
on the wisp by the tree to collect it into the Keystone. Vessa thanks you for helping her, and she'll give you
rewards
when you find a certain amount. There are 107 wisps that have been scattered across Hisui, and you can also talk to her to find out how many are remaining.
You receive
Request 22: Eerie Apparitions in the Night
. You can refer to
Spiritomb Wisps
for additional details. This is the only
request
that is automatically obtained in the main story.
Arezu, one of the wardens of the Diamond Clan
Hairdresser of the Diamond Clan
You return to bed. The next day, a girl in a Diamond Clan outfit shouts about how amazing the Jubilife Village
hairdresser
is. She recognizes you as the person who quelled Kleavor's frenzy and introduces herself as
Arezu
, a
warden
of the
Diamond Clan
. Her hobby is that she gives haircuts. She had intended on speaking with Kamado, so she leaves. This isn't the last time you'll see her, however, as you receive a mission:
Arezu's Predicament
.
The player receiving their second star
Head inside
Galaxy Hall
, and go up to the third floor to reach Kamado's office. When you approach, you overhear Arezu and Kamado having a conversation. An
Ursaluna
has gone into a frenzy, much like the
noble
Kleavor
. Arezu turned to the Galaxy Team, because both clan leaders are busy and Ursaluna's
warden
is too stubborn to let her help.
You enter into the room. Kamado orders you to head to a new area, the
Crimson Mirelands
, to study the Ursaluna. You nod and head down to
Cyllene
's office for the details. Cyllene informs you that the Crimson Mirelands is filled with more dangerous Pokémon and a harsher landscape, so this won't be easy. You must be a Second Star to go to the Crimson Mirelands.
If you haven't already, earn enough research points to
rank
up to Second Star (you need 1,800 points). You can refer to
Part 2
of this walkthrough for details.
When you earn enough research points, talk to Cyllene to show her your Pokédex.
You've become a
Second Star recruit
!
As a Second Star recruit, you can use a new type of Poké Ball called a
Feather Ball
, which flies in a straight line and is intended for certain flying encounters. In addition, Pokémon up to level 30 will obey you in battle and you'll earn more money from survey reports. Cyllene hands you the crafting recipes for Feather Balls and
Super Potions
.
After reaching Second Star rank, Cyllene gives you the details of your mission. You must head to a place called the
Solaceon Ruins
to find
Calaba
, Ursaluna's warden.
Some practice before the trip
Head outside of Galaxy Hall and go to the front gate. Rei/Akari meets you there, and they challenge you to a battle to train them again!
Rei/Akari leads with
Mime Jr.
, a
Psychic
/
Fairy-type
Pokémon. It's weak to
Poison
,
Ghost
, and
Steel-type
attacks. Watch for its
Hypnosis
: it causes
Drowsy
, which increases the damage taken of the inflicted Pokémon and gives them a chance to be too sleepy to act on their turn.
Then, they send out their main partner,
Pikachu
, which is
Electric-type
. Electric-type Pokémon are only weak to
Ground-type
attacks. Ground-type Pokémon are also immune to Electric-type moves, so it would make a perfect counter to their Pikachu. Also, watch for
Thunder Wave
: it causes
Paralysis
, which reduces the
Speed
of the inflicted Pokémon and gives them a chance to be too weak to act on their turn.

After defeating Rei/Akari, they hand you a new recipe for

Space-time distortions (Optional)
A space-time distortion before it has formed
A space-time distortion that has formed
Now that you have access to
space-time distortions
, there's some preparation that you need in order to make the most out of them. They drop many
items
for
evolution
, items for earning
money
, and most importantly, exclusive rare Pokémon! They can spawn every 5 to 40 minutes, meaning it can be a very long time until another one appears.
When a space-time distortion is about to begin, you'll receive a notification that reads, "
A space-time distortion seems to be forming!
". Press
Minus
(-) to open your
Arc Phone
to see where it is on the map. If it hasn't begun, it appears as a semi-transparent hemisphere.
Preparation
When you first receive the notification, that means it hasn't formed yet and you have a few minutes to prepare. It won't begin until you receive a follow-up message that reads, "
A space-time distortion appeared!
", which means you should head there as soon as possible.
Only bring the essentials. Empty as much of your
satchel
as you can, and make sure you're prepared with
Poké Balls
and healing items like
Revives
and
Potions
.
Bring a couple of Pokémon for catching. This typically includes a Pokémon with
False Swipe
and another with a
move
that inflicts a
status
like
Hypnosis
or
Thunder Wave
.
At any point, if you ever rest at the tent to heal your Pokémon,
ONLY rest "Just for a little while".
Any other option will change the time of day and the distortion with disappear. Of course, returning to Jubilife Village,
blacking out
, or closing the game will also make the distortion disappear.
When it begins
Head to the area where the distortion is on the map. It appears as a hemisphere of thunderous dark clouds. Inside, there's a lot going on, but don't panic: there's only a few things to know.
Rare items will begin appearing on the ground. Press
Plus
(+) to
ride
Wyrdeer
and press
A
whenever you come across an item. Keep moving and searching around the entire area of the distortion.
Pokémon will begin appearing in front of you, in groups of 2 to 4. After a few seconds, they will despawn and a new group will take its place. If you want to catch one, throw out a Pokémon, and the Pokémon will stop despawning. (Being in battle or opening a menu pauses time, including the time it takes for new Pokémon to spawn, or the time before the distortion disappears.)
Otherwise, keep moving around on Wyrdeer to avoid their attacks until they despawn. Be careful, as many Pokémon can be a very high level or even be an
alpha
.
When it's finished
Once the space-time distortion is over, the area returns to normal and all of the exclusive Pokémon and items disappear.
Congratulations! You've completed your first space-time distortion!
You should return to a
base camp
to heal your Pokémon and empty all of the new items you've collected into the item storage.
You may sell any
Nuggets
or
Star Pieces
you've collected, but
DO NOT sell your
Stardust
. Star Pieces sell for significantly more than Stardust. Later in the story, you can unlock a
recipe
to
craft
Star Pieces using Stardust,
Red Shards
,
Blue Shards
, and
Green Shards
.
New Pokémon in the Obsidian Fieldlands
This is an updated list of encounters to include Pokémon in space-time distortions in the
Obsidian Fieldlands
. They also now include
mass outbreaks
, which are events where you can encounter multiple of a certain Pokémon with increased
Shiny
rates!
Ramanas Island
and most of
Lake Verity
are still inaccessible, so they will be covered later.

Crimson Mirelands
Laventon greets you when you arrive in the
Crimson Mirelands
for the first time, as it's teeming with poison-type Pokémon. Rei/Akari heard about your mission to help Ursaluna, and they point you to the
Solaceon Ruins
up north. They set off to look for space-time distortions.
Laventon also suggests that if you ever have any trouble, have
Zisu
teach your Pokémon new strong moves. You can also have her use
Seeds of Mastery
to
master
those moves and enable agile/strong style. You should also use any
Grit
items you may have (like
Grit Dust
or
Grit Gravel
) to increase your Pokémon's
effort levels
and
stats
. The most important stat is
Speed
, due its direct effect on
action speed
.
Make sure your Pokémon are at least level 20 before proceeding.
All of the areas in the Crimson Mirelands
New areas to explore (Optional)
Now that you've arrived in the Crimson Mirelands, there's tons of new Pokémon to catch! With
Wyrdeer
, you have access to the entire map! You can reach
Golden Lowlands
,
Gapejaw Bog
,
Ursa's Ring
,
Sludge Mound
,
Scarlet Bog
,
Cloudpool Ridge
,
Shrouded Ruins
,
Diamond Heath
,
Diamond Settlement
,
Bolderoll Slope
,
Cottonsedge Prairie
,
Droning Meadow
,
Lake Valor
, and even the
Holm of Trials
!
To reach the Holm of Trials, you'll have to jump across a shallow part of the river near Sludge Mound. There's a few spots it
looks
like you can jump, but only one of them is actually thin enough to jump across.

Warden of the Pearl Clan's Ursaluna
Calaba, one of the wardens of the Pearl Clan
Head to the Solaceon ruins and continue inside. Approach the older woman in a pink hoodie with a
Bibarel
. She introduces herself as
warden
Calaba
of the
Pearl Clan
. She notices your
Celestica Flute
and recognizes you as the one who quelled
noble
Kleavor
's frenzy. However, she judges you for the way you handled it and the Poké Balls you use, and decides she doesn't need your or the
Diamond Clan
's help. She tells you to leave, and walks off deeper in the cave.
Volo arrives in the ruins, as he mentioned earlier. He wants you to show him the strength that quelled a frenzied noble, and challenges you to another battle!
This time, his
Togepi
knows
Draining Kiss
, a
Fairy-type
attack that can also heal based on how much damage is dealt. You can bring a
Fire
,
Poison
, or
Steel-type
Pokémon if you're struggling to deal with this attack.
He also brought a Gible, a

After defeating Volo, he complements your strength and heals your Pokémon. He asks for your help to retrieve a stolen
Wall Fragment
. A group of bandits called the
Miss Fortunes
stole a chunk of the wall engravings from Solaceon Ruins. They even stole from the Ginkgo Guild! Calaba's been trying to chase them down, but she's having trouble at her age. Volo suggests that you check out a mysterious campfire near the Mirelands Camp.
The Miss Fortunes
The Miss Fortune sisters, (from left to right) Clover, Charm, and Coin
Head near the Mirelands Camp and instead head east, along the river. Approach the campsite: you hypothesize that someone must have been here, when you hear a voice—3 hostile women, who you can easily presume are the Miss Fortunes. They introduce themselves as
Charm
, the eldest,
Clover
, the middle sister, and
Coin
, the youngest.
Coin is challenges you to a battle, alongside her partner Pokémon
Toxicroak
. Defeat her to take back the Wall Fragment!

After defeating her, she reveals that she once was a part of the
Galaxy Team
, but left. She gives you the Wall Fragment for defeating her. Charm asks you why you were seeking them out, and you answer that it was for Ursaluna or Calaba. Charm explains that not everyone has the luxury to help others, as some people struggle just to survive. She also has a score to settle with the Galaxy Team, reads out the Wall Fragment, threatens you, and leaves.

Return the Wall Fragment
Calaba playing her Celestica Flute to call Ursaluna
Head to Solaceon Ruins with the good news: you have secured the Wall Fragment! Approach Volo, who commends you for your effort. Volo explains that even though Calaba is stubborn, it's because she loves the Pearl Clan a lot and not because of any actual hate. Volo wishes you luck on quelling Ursaluna, and heads out.
Approach Calaba in the back of the cave. She's as stubborn as ever, but you hand her the Wall Fragment. She puts it back into place, and it reads, "All lives touch other lives to create something anew and alive..." Calaba interprets the message to mean that people can help each other to reach greater heights, and she understands what it means now. She asks for your name and for your help to calm down Ursaluna. Because it's not in a full frenzy like Kleavor, he'll return to normal with some medicine.
Head to Sludge Mound
Calaba says to meet her on
Sludge Mound
when you're ready. Head to Sludge Mound and approach Calaba. After Calaba plays her Celestica Flute, Ursaluna appears! She wishes you luck with taking it on, but she won't allow you to catch it as it's important to the Pearl Clan.
Ursaluna is

The player finding items with Ursaluna
Finding items with Ursaluna
After taking out the Ursaluna, Calaba feeds it a special medicine of the Pearl Clan, called a "Toxi-Gone", meant to clear poisons. Ursaluna cries out of disgust, but it has now calmed down. Strangely, it's not in a frenzy, and you can tell because it's not glowing like Kleavor.
Calaba asks you to play your Celestica Flute. Ursaluna learns the sound of your playing and you can now
ride
it! It also gives you the
Earth Plate
. Calaba explains that it's good at digging, and suggests that you report to commander
Kamado
about what happened.
You can now ride Ursaluna! As always, you can summon a Ride Pokémon by pressing
Plus
(+). You can also swap between your Ride Pokémon by pressing
Left
or
Right
on the D-pad. You can't throw any items or Pokémon out while on a Ride Pokémon, so press
Plus
(+) again to quickly dismount.
Ursaluna acts as an alternative to the
Dowsing Machine
, which was used in previous games to look for hidden items. A colored radar will appear in front of Ursaluna, starting off as the color green. If it turns yellow or red, that means it's getting close to an item and it'll run faster. A red "!" icon will appear if you're on top of an item, and you can press
Y
to dig it up.

The Symbol Pokémon
Head to a base camp and talk to Professor Laventon. He notices something odd stuck to your back, and it turns out to be a Pokémon in the shape of the letter A: it's an
Unown
! Laventon heard Volo mention that the carvings on the walls of Solaceon Ruins resembled writing, and he hypothesizes that the carvings are meant to resemble this Pokémon!
Laventon adds a new section to your Pokédex called the
Unown Research Notes
! Unown will be hidden in certain spots on the map, but they won't move or battle you. Throw empty Poké Balls at these hidden Unown, because you are unable to battle them. The Unown Research Notes also include hints on where you can find them.
You can refer to
Unown Locations
for a detailed walkthrough on the locations of the Unown.
When you're ready, talk to Professor Laventon again to return to
