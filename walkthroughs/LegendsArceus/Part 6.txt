Walkthrough Text:
Jubilife Village
You return to
Jubilife Village
. Head to
Galaxy Hall
and go up to
Kamado
's office to report what happened.
When you approach,
Adaman
and
Beni
are urgently speaking with Kamado. The
Diamond Clan
's
noble
Lilligant
, the Lady of the Ridge, is in a frenzy.
Arezu
hid this information from Adaman, but she's nowhere to be found. She was last seen at the
Wallflower
by Beni, but she's disappeared. Kamado is suspicious of her, and this information could lead the Diamond and
Pearl Clans
to go to war once again. The
Galaxy Team
would have to remain neutral and not take part in the fighting.
Commander Kamado asks you if you have any ideas, and you suggest that you could use
Ursaluna
to find Arezu. Adaman and Kamado agree to the plan, and wish you luck in quelling Lilligant's frenzy. Adaman will meet you at
Brava Arena
in the
Crimson Mirelands
. Kamado explains that the Galaxy Team came to
Hisui
to make a new home without war or strife, so you must quell the frenzy of these important noble Pok√©mon.
When you're ready, head to the
front gate
and depart for the
Crimson Mirelands
.
