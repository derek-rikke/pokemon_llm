Pokémon Center
Visit the Pokémon Center and speak to the female Ace Trainer near the counter to receive the
Vs. Seeker
. This device draws the attention of any nearby Trainers that you previously defeated who would like a rematch. The battery is drained after each use and must be recharged, reaching full capacity after 100 steps have been taken. The device cannot be used in buildings or caves.
Fishing Guru 1
Visit the house in the northwest part of town to meet a Fisherman known as the
Fishing Guru
. Convince him that you love fishing as much as he does, and he rewards you with an
Old Rod
. This particular model is not the most impressive fishing rod, but it is useful for reeling in
Magikarp
.
Time for a Trade
Stop by the house in the middle of the city and speak to the girl inside. She is hoping to
trade
for a
Spearow
, and is willing to part with her
Farfetch'd
for one. Spearow are found nearly everywhere, but Farfetch'd is one of a kind. The Pokémon arrives holding a
Stick
, which boosts its
critical hit
ratio.
Pokémon Fan Club
The building to the north of the
Vermilion Gym
is home to the
Pokémon Fan Club
. Speak to the Chairman and listen to his rambling thoughts to receive a
Bike Voucher
in appreciation. With this ticket, you can return to the Bike Shop in
Cerulean City
at any time and exchange it for a
Bicycle
. Riding a bike allows you to travel twice as fast as walking speed.

This part of the ship is a dead-end hallway with five cabins. Visit the right-most room for a
Super Potion
and the middle room for an
Ether
. Pick up
TM44
(
Rest
) in the fourth room from the stairs, then head back up to the main floor.
1F
Follow the hallway around to the front of the ship, and visit the second cabin from the left to get
TM31
(
Brick Break
). Turn the corner and continue on to reach the kitchen. Grab the
Great Ball
in the corner and inspect the three trash cans for any forgotten items. Leave the kitchen and climb the nearest stairs to reach the upper floor.
2F
The nearest doorway leads to the deck of the ship, where two Sailors are looking to battle. Step inside the second cabin from the left to get a
Stardust
, then visit the fourth room to pick up an
X Attack
. When you approach the captain's quarters at the back of the ship,
Blue
is just leaving.
Rival Battle 4
He again leads with his
Pidgeotto
, so use
Electric
and
Rock
moves for best results. His
Rattata
has evolved into
Raticate
, with an increased
Attack
stat that allows it to deal even greater damage with
Hyper Fang
. Blue's
Abra
has evolved as well, though its low
Defense
still leaves it exposed to physical moves. His
first Pokémon
has grown into its second stage as well. It is best to avoid pitting your own against it and use a Pokémon with a type advantage instead.

Despite his loss, he taunts you again as usual before walking away. Enter the captain's quarters to find him hunched over a trash can; it seems like he got seasick. Speak to him to help him out with a quick backrub and he will be feeling good as new. He gives you
HM01
(
Cut
) to show his appreciation. This field move lets you chop down certain inconveniently-placed trees to reach new areas.
Be sure to collect all of the items on board before leaving, as the ship sets sail when you do. Use
HM01
to teach
Cut
to a compatible Pokémon, then set out for the Vermilion Gym.

Vermilion Gym
VERMILION CITY POKéMON GYM
LEADER: LT. SURGE
The Lightning American!
The
Vermilion Gym
specializes in
Electric-type
Pokémon. Electric-type moves are super effective against
Flying
- and
Water-type
Pokémon, while Electric-type Pokémon are weak to
Ground-type
moves.
The Gym Leader can be found in the back room, beyond a set of electronic doors. Reaching him requires challengers to
flip two switches
hidden randomly among the many trash cans. Once the first switch has been found, the second will be in an adjacent can. If the wrong can is inspected and there is no switch inside, the puzzle resets.
Lt. Surge
leads with his
Voltorb
. Its
Attack
stat may be low, but
Screech
lowers the target's
Defense
so that it can deal an increased amount of damage. His
Pikachu
can
paralyze
the target with
Thunder Wave
, so be sure to bring a
Parlyz Heal
or two.
Raichu
's high
Special Attack
lets it deal a good bit of damage with
Thunderbolt
. Use Ground moves like
Dig
for best results.
