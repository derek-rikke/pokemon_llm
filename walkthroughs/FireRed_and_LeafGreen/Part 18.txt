Pallet Town
A World Expands
After defeating the elite Trainers at
Indigo Plateau
, the new Champion returns home to
Pallet Town
.
Professor Oak
pays you a visit and inspects the progress you have made on your
Pokédex
. He tells you that he has a favor to ask, and leads you to his lab. The professor explains that there have been many sightings recently of rare Pokémon species that have never been seen before in
Kanto
. He would like to study these Pokémon for himself, but his advanced age means that he must rely on you instead.
Blue
enters a short time later, and Oak takes each Trainer's Pokédex for a moment. If each device has recorded data on at least 60 different species, he upgrades them to
National Mode
. This enhancement enables the Pokédex to identify these rare Pokémon species so that you may now begin encountering them. Blue insists that he will be the one to complete the Pokédex, and considers looking around
One Island
first. Follow his lead and use
Fly
to return to
Vermilion City
and take the ferry back to the
Sevii Islands
.

Ruby
B5F; on the pedestal (requires
Strength
)
FR
LG
Exterior
Go east from the Hiker near the entrance to find that the two
Team Rocket
Grunts have finally punched through the wall. They can be overheard excitedly planning to bring any treasure they may find back to the
Rocket Warehouse
. The building seems to require two passwords to enter. One of the Grunts has already forgotten them, but the other helpfully reminds him of the first one:
"
Goldeen
need log"
. But before he can reveal the second password, they realize that you have been listening in and draw you into battle. Defeat them and they run off to regroup, leaving the new cave entrance exposed.
Ruby Path
1F
There are several rocks in the first tunnel that can be cleared with
Rock Smash
. Go northwest and climb down the ladder.
B1F
Head northward and pass through more
breakable rocks
to reach the ladder.
B2
Go east to find the path blocked by several boulders. Use
Strength
to move the first boulder (→2) eastward. Take a few steps to the southeast and push the second (→1) eastward, as well. Move the northernmost boulder (↑1) northward, then go south and climb down the ladder.
B3F
Clearing the
breakable rocks
on this level may reveal wild
Slugma
or
Magcargo
, some of the rare Pokémon
Oak
spoke of when he upgraded your
Pokédex
. Head east and use
Strength
to move the boulder (→1, ↓1) southeastward to clear a path. A short distance ahead, the path splits in two. Follow the southern tunnel and push the boulder all the way westward. Walk down the stairway and climb down the ladder to the south.
B4F
On this level, a series of glass panels are arranged to display the
Braille
alphabet, letter by letter. Climb down the ladder in the southeast corner.
B5F
Examine the pedestal to obtain the
Ruby
. A panel on the north wall features another Braille inscription. Take the ladder and climb back up to B3F.

B3F
Return to the branching tunnels and take the eastern path this time. Move the northern boulder (→1) eastward, then the southern boulder (←1) westward. Continue southward and climb up the ladder. This short path acts as a shortcut back to the entrance, ending in the northeast part of 1F.
One Island (Town)
Pokémon Network Center
Return to
Celio
to deliver the
Ruby
. He happily installs the gemstone in his Network Machine, but has another favor to ask. While studying gemstones, he discovered that there is a second that forms a pair with the Ruby. The only information that he has to work with is that it is somewhere in the
Sevii Islands
. To help you on your new quest, he takes back your
Tri-Pass
and gives you his personal
Rainbow Pass
, which allows travel among all seven of the islands. He also adds another page to your
Town Map
that shows the other four islands.
Four Island
Four Island
Four Island (Town)
The town of
Four Island
is a small settlement on the southwest side of
Four Island
. A second
Pokémon Day Care
can be found here, and the eastern side of the island houses
Icefall Cave
.

A Rival Reappears
When you leave the port, you run into
Blue
on the beach. He wonders what you are doing in the
Sevii Islands
, and tells you to stop copying him. He brags about obtaining a
Pokémon Egg
, and hints that he saw someone you both know on the island. Afterward, he pushes you aside to enter the port.
Pokémon Day Care
A second
Pokémon Day Care
is located on the north side of town. While the Day Care on
Route 5
can only accept one Pokémon at a time, this location can accommodate up to two at once. If two
compatible
Pokémon are left at the same time, you may return to find an
Egg
!
Move Tutor
There are two men in the northeast house. Speak to the one on the left to learn that they are having a Body Slam match to see who wimps out first. He says that you would be squashed like a bug if you joined them, so he offers to teach
Body Slam
to a compatible Pokémon of yours instead.

may be found.

is furious for what they have done to its friends, and persuades them to talk after an

The Ultimate Horn
The northern island holds two isolated homes. In the northern house, there is a woman who likes big
Heracross
and wishes to see the "ultimate horn". If you show her a Heracross, she will measure its
size
and reward you with a
Nest Ball
. After doing so, she will give out another Nest Ball for each Heracross that you show her that sets a new record. The current record is displayed on a chart on the back wall. Heracross can be found in the nearby
Pattern Bush
to the west.
Green Path
Green Path
consists of the western part of the smaller island, including
Pattern Bush
, and a pair of tiny rocky islets farther west.
Outcast Island
lies off to the north.

Pattern Bush
is a small forest covered with thick undergrowth, a perfect habitat for the many
Bug
Pokémon that reside here. There are odd patterns where tall grass refuses to grow, leading the Trainers here to form their own theories. Some study it in the belief that a secret is concealed.

Exploring the Ruins
The entrance to the
Dotted Hole
has been sealed tight for ages and refuses to budge. On further inspection, there are several dots on the door; this
Braille
message translates to the word "
Cut
". Using the field move here causes the door to open.
Dotted Hole
The
Dotted Hole
is a mysterious ruin from an ancient time. It got its name from the six dots on its door.
1F
There is nothing of interest on the ground level, so jump down through the hole in the floor to reach B1F.
B1F-B4F
The next several levels each display a panel with a word shown in
Braille
and have four gaps in the floor, one near each wall. Any visitors would need to decipher the message on each level to learn the correct path forward. Starting on B1F, jump down through each hole in order (up, left, right, down) to reach the lowest level.
B5F
On the lowest level, you find the
Sapphire
on display, just like the
Ruby
in
Mt. Ember
. When you attempt to grab it,
a Scientist
suddenly drops down from the level above. He followed you so that you would open the ruins, and intends to sell the gemstone to
Team Rocket
! Seemingly feeling a bit guilty, he suggests that you can retrieve it after he gets his money. He even offers a password for the
Rocket Warehouse
—
"Yes, nah,
Chansey
"
—before climbing the ladder and making his escape.
A panel on the north wall features another Braille inscription.
