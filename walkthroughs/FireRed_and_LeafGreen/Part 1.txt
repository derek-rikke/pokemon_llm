Introduction
After a brief cutscene, press the A Button or
Start
on the title screen. The player is presented with a list of controls in order of importance, then with a mission statement from the games' developers. Afterward, the resident researcher of the
Kanto
region,
Professor Oak
, appears and introduces new Trainers to the Pokémon world.
First, the player is prompted to select their avatar's gender and name, which may be up to seven characters long. Use the Control Pad to move the cursor and the
Select
Button to cycle through three pages of upper-case letters, lower-case letters, and other characters. On this screen, pressing the A Button will select a letter while pressing the B Button will delete the previous one. When ready, press
Start
or select
OK
in the bottom-right corner.
Next,
Professor Oak
introduces
his grandson
, who happens to be your
rival
. The professor is having trouble remembering the boy's name, and asks if you might know. Choose his name from a list of preset names, or select a new one. With that done, the player is transported into the world of Pokémon to begin their adventure!

Pallet Town
Pallet Town
The journey begins in
Pallet Town
, in the southwest part of the
Kanto
region. It is a rather small, sleepy town with only three buildings. The western house belongs to you and
Mom
, while the eastern one is home to
your rival
and his sister. The large building to the south is
Professor Oak
's
Laboratory
. The north part of town leads to the
tall grasses
of
Route 1
, and the waters to the south open up to
Route 21
.

The journey begins in your bedroom, with you standing in front of your
Super Nintendo Entertainment System
. Now that you can control your character, the various buttons and their effects are as follows:

Help System
The
PC
in the corner acts as both your
item storage
and Mailbox.
The
Bag
has three pockets: one for Items, one for
Key Items
, and one for
Poké Balls
. Each pocket can hold up to 42 different
items
and up to 999 of each item. If a pocket becomes full, it would be necessary to use or discard some items before obtaining anything new. The PC can hold up to 30 different items from the Items pocket.
Deposit Item
and
Withdraw Item
allow for moving items between inventory and storage. It seems as though there is already an item in storage, so select
Withdraw Item
and choose the
Potion
to add it to your Bag. Press the B Button to close the menus and return to your bedroom. To save the game, press
Start
to open the main menu, select
Save
, and then
Yes
. When the menu disappears, your progress is saved and it is safe to exit the game.
Mail
is a type of
held item
. A Trainer may leave a note on each piece of Mail when giving one to a Pokémon. This message can be sent to other Trainers by trading Pokémon. When taking a piece of Mail from a Pokémon, a Trainer may choose to place it in their Bag or send it to their Mailbox. Storing it in the Mailbox preserves the original message.
To go downstairs, step on the stairs in the northeast corner of the room.
1F
Mom
is sitting at the table, and tells you that
Professor Oak
has been looking for you. To leave the house, step on the floor mat along the south wall and press down on the +Control Pad.
Oak Appears!
Pallet Town
has only a few places to explore, and
Professor Oak
is nowhere to be found. There is nothing else to do around here right now, so head for the
tall grass
on the north side of town. Suddenly, the professor appears! He scolds you for trying to venture off on your own, as it can be dangerous without a Pokémon of your own for defense against
wild Pokémon
.
Professor Oak's Lab
Oak leads you back to his lab where
Blue
is already waiting, and gives you the choice of your
very first Pokémon
. Each has its advantages and disadvantages, so simply choose the one that you like the best.

The
Grass
/
Poison
-type
Bulbasaur
does well against
Water
-,
Rock
-, and
Ground-type
Pokémon. It also has the most weaknesses of the trio, and fares poorly against
Fire
-,
Flying
-,
Psychic
-, and
Ice
attacks. Bulbasaur's typing gives it an easier time in the early part of the game, making it a good choice for less experienced Trainers.
The
Fire-type
Charmander
is great when battling
Grass
-,
Bug
-,
Ice
-, and
Steel-type
Pokémon, but is vulnerable to
Water
-,
Rock
-, and
Ground-type
moves. Its final form,
Charizard
, gains a secondary
Flying
type. Charmander may struggle early on, so it is a good choice for those looking for a challenge.
The
Water-type
Squirtle
has an advantage when facing
Fire
-,
Rock
-, and
Ground-type
Pokémon, but may struggle against
Grass
- and
Electric-type
attacks. It is the most well-rounded of the trio.
Once you have chosen a Pokémon, you are given the chance to
nickname
it. Next, it's your rival's turn. He will always choose the Pokémon that has a type advantage against your own. When you turn to leave, he will challenge you to your first
Pokémon battle
!
Rival Battle 1
As you and
Blue
face off,
Professor Oak
explains the basics. When battling, each Trainer sends out at least one Pokémon at a time; both of these Pokémon are on
Level
5, indicated by the
Lv5
aside each Pokémon. Below that is the health bar, which shows the Pokémon's remaining
HP
. A battle is won or lost when either side has no remaining Pokémon with the strength to continue. Beneath the health bar is a gauge that shows the amount of
Experience Points
needed for the Pokémon to grow to the next level.
Choosing
Fight
will allow you to launch an attack against the target. Each of
the professor's Pokémon
have two moves. The first will damage the opponent, and the other will lower one of its stats. If your Pokémon's HP runs low, be sure to use that Potion from your PC. Go to
Item
to select the medicine and apply it to the Pokémon.
