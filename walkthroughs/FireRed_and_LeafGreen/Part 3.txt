Antidote
and turn west to the tall grass. Zigzag westward through the trees to reach a signpost. Explore the dead-end path to the southeast to get another

Calling All Challengers
The local
Gym Leader
is looking for challengers, and the kid blocking the city's east exit will escort you to the Gym if you try to leave. This is the first city to sell
Potions
, so stock up at the Poké Mart before taking up the challenge.
Pewter Museum of Science
The
Pewter Museum of Science
is located on the north side of the city. It hosts a wide range of artifacts and exhibits, with a focus on
fossil
excavation and space exploration. Admission to the main building is
$
50 for a child's ticket. The smaller building next door is closed to the public.
Pewter Gym
Pewter Gym
PEWTER CITY POKéMON GYM
LEADER: BROCK
The Rock-Solid POKéMON Trainer!
The
Pewter Gym
specializes in
Rock-type
Pokémon. Rock-type moves are super effective against
Bug
-,
Fire
-,
Flying
-, and
Ice-type
Pokémon, while Rock-type Pokémon are weak to
Fighting
-,
Grass
-,
Ground
-,
Steel
-, and
Water-type
moves. All of the Pokémon in the Pewter Gym are partly Ground type, as well, leaving them immune to
Electric
attacks.
Both of
Brock
's Pokémon are part-
Rock
and part-
Ground
, so they take massive damage from
Grass
and
Water
attacks. Trainers who chose
Bulbasaur
or
Squirtle
will likely not have much trouble. Trainers who chose
Charmander
, however, may have a more difficult time.
Fire
attacks target the foe's
Special Defense
, and despite
Geodude
and
Onix
having a low rating in this stat, their type combination resists damage from Fire moves. It may be more useful to raise Charmander to level 13 when it learns
Metal Claw
, a
Steel-type
move that deals serious damage to Rock Pokémon and may raise its physical
Attack
. As an alternative, the
Fighting-type
Mankey
can be found on
Route 22
, and learns both
Low Kick
and
Karate Chop
early on.

After the battle,
Brock
awards you the
Boulder Badge
, which gives your Pokémon a slight
Attack
boost during battle and enables the use of
Flash
in the field. He also gives you
TM39
(
Rock Tomb
) as a prize.
Heading Out on a Hike
With the
Pewter Gym
defeated, your next destination is
Cerulean City
to the east. Visit the Poké Mart for Potions and Poké Balls, and consider getting
Repels
and an
Escape Rope
or two for the cave up ahead. Once you are ready, head east to reach
Route 3
. At the city's edge, you are stopped by one of
Professor Oak
's
aides
, sent here with a delivery from
Mom
. Any big adventure requires good footwear, and that is exactly what he has brought along. With the
Running Shoes
, holding down the B Button allows you to move even faster than normal!
