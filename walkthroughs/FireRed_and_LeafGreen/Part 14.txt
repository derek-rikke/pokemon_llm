Pokémon Network Center
Upon reaching
One Island
,
Bill
leads you into the
Pokémon Network Center
and introduces you to his friend
Celio
, a programmer who runs the PC network for the
Sevii Islands
. The building functions as a traditional Pokémon Center and also houses the Pokémon Network Machine. Celio is currently performing maintenance on the machine, but the islands are too remote and the machine is having trouble connecting to Bill's PC system on the
Kanto
mainland. Until maintenance is complete, the normal PC services will be unavailable.
Deliver the Meteorite
While he and Celio get to work on the machine, Bill asks you a favor: visit nearby
Two Island
and speak to the man who runs the Game Corner there. He has an interest in rare rocks and gems, and Bill has a
Meteorite
for you to deliver to him. To help with this task, Celio gives you a
Tri-Pass
, a ferry ticket that enables travel between the three northernmost islands in the archipelago. He also gives you a second page for the
Town Map
that displays
One Island
,
Two Island
, and
Three Island
.

Treasure Beach

Treasure Beach
, known for the valuable items that regularly wash up on the shore. The tides usually replace these items by the next day, allowing treasure hunters to easily stockpile these rare items.

Ember Spa
Ember Spa is a small hot spring. By standing in the middle of the water, people and Pokémon can relax and restore their health.
Mind Over Matter
The old man standing between the two waterfalls claims to have carved the cave out of a gigantic boulder many years ago. As he no longer needs the tool he used, he gives the
HM06
(
Rock Smash
) to you. This field move allows you to remove
weak-looking rocks
to clear a path.
Certain Pokémon
like to hide themselves under these rocks, and will attack when their hiding place is removed!
Mt. Ember
Mt. Ember
is a dormant volcano located at the northernmost point of
One Island
, across a small channel from Ember Spa.

Two Island
Two Island
is a tiny island with little more than a Pokémon Center. The
Joyful Game Corner
is located here, and the Market Stall offers different items over time. Unlike in the town of
One Island
, the waters around the port are too rough, making it impossible to surf or fish.

Move Maniac
The house to the south of the Market Stall belongs to the
Move Maniac
. He claims to know every single move a Pokémon can learn as it grows up, and can re-teach any move that a Pokémon had forgotten. As a mushroom enthusiast, he accepts either two
TinyMushrooms
or one
Big Mushroom
per transaction as payment.
Joyful Game Corner
The
Joyful Game Corner
is located on the east side of town. When you enter, you find the owner pacing around the building. It seems that his daughter,
Lostelle
, likes to bring lunch for him every day, but he is starting to worry as she is running late. He pleads with you to search
Three Island
. A Biker suddenly enters the building, mistaking the area for Three Island. The owner chases him out, and asks again that you save Lostelle.
Cape Brink
Cape Brink
is a short mountain road on the island's north side. The lone house here belongs to a Channeler who has perfected the ultimate
Grass
,
Fire
, and
Water
moves. She offers to teach
Frenzy Plant
to
Venusaur
,
Blast Burn
to
Charizard
, and
Hydro Cannon
to
Blastoise
. Each of these attacks may only be taught once each, and only to your original
partner Pokémon
.
Three Island
Three Island
Berry Forest
Berry Forest, with Berry locations
Three Island
consists of two plots of land: a larger island to the east that holds the town of
Three Island
, and a smaller wooded islet to the west where the
Berry Forest
is located.
Three Isle Port
Three Isle Port
is located on the south side of the island, connecting the port to the town of
Three Island
. A small cave leads into the cliffside to the east.
Trouble in Paradise
Upon leaving the port, you find several rowdy Bikers harassing the residents. That must mean trouble for the town, as well!
Three Isle Path
Three Isle Path
is a small cave on the southeast side of the larger island. The cliffside here is rumored to hide a large deposit of gold, and one of the residents mines tirelessly for the precious metal.

The Lure of the Ore
By the time you receive the

Nugget
with you. This tunnel opens to an isolated cliff with a single patch of tall grass, inhabited only by
Dunsparce
.
Three Island (Town)
The town of
Three Island
encompasses nearly half of the larger island. The local Pokémon Center and Poké Mart are located on the east side, and the house belonging to
Lostelle
and her father can be found to the west.

Network Machine: Online
By the time you arrive in town,
Bill
and
Celio
's work on the Network Machine has successfully linked the
Pokémon Network Center
with Bill's PC system on
the mainland
, restoring all normal PC functions in the process.
Biker, Begone!
Several more Bikers can be found causing trouble near the Pokémon Center. Approach the gang and one of them asks if you really want to take them on. Defeat the
Kanto Rider Federation
in four consecutive battles and they reluctantly leave the island in peace.
Lostelle's house
The house with the red roof in the southwest part of town belongs to
Lostelle
and her father. She is still nowhere to be found, so she must have gone deeper into the island. With the Bikers gone, one of the residents informs you that she had gone west toward
Bond Bridge
.
Bond Bridge
Bond Bridge
connects the main island with the western islet and the
Berry Forest
. Several Trainers can be found here, and valuable items sometimes wash up near the bridge.
