Silph Co.
The
Silph Co
. is the leading manufacturer of items like Poké Balls, Potions, and TMs. Their products are supplied to every Poké Mart in the region. The company has been a target of
Team Rocket
, first for their
Silph Scope
prototype, and now for a top-secret development project. The Rocket Grunt posted outside the building has fallen asleep, leaving a perfect opportunity to sneak inside. The building holds eleven floors, with
warp tiles
allowing the workers to quickly move around. This convenience ends up acting as a maze for anyone trying to reach the top floor.

With

defeated,

's plans for

have been thwarted. He vows that the group will never fall and promises to return. Giovanni and his underlings make their escape, while their co-conspirators also flee the building. Speak to the president, who is so grateful to you for saving Silph that he rewards you with the
Master Ball
prototype. This improved kind of Poké Ball has a 100% success rate, so be sure to save it for a hard-to-catch Pokémon.
Copycat's house
Move Tutor
Now that the Rockets have left the city, the Grunt outside the northwest house is gone. A girl inside known as the

likes to collect

Fighting Dojo
Fighting Dojo
Saffron City
is unique as the only city to have two Pokémon Gyms. The
Fighting Dojo
is located in the northeast neighborhood, next door to the
Saffron Gym
. The two clubs had once competed to determine which would become the city's one official Gym, and the
Psychic
Pokémon of Saffron Gym were victorious. There is no Badge to be won here, but defeat the
Karate Master
to earn the choice of two rare
Fighting-type
Pokémon: the hard-kicking
Hitmonlee
or the piston-punching
Hitmonchan
. Use Psychic- and
Flying-type
attacks here for greatest effect.

Pokémon, while Psychic-type Pokémon are weak to
Bug
-,
Dark
-, and
Ghost-type
moves.
The Gym uses
