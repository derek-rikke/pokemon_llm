Spinner maze
Enter the maze of

to reach the stopper tile in the southwest corner. Walk carefully northeastward and step on the spinner with the east-facing arrow; this leads to a stopper tile in the north-central part of the maze. Go east and step on the row of spinners leading south to reach another stopper tile in the southwest corner. Follow the path to reach a
Pearl
near the west wall. Take the north-facing row of spinners to the northwest room; pick up the
Up-Grade
and battle the female Rocket Grunt. On the east side of the northwest room, step on the western spinner tile to stop near the maze entrance in the southeast. From here, you can detour southward to reach a
Big Pearl
, or continue northward to battle the next Rocket Grunt. Take the spinner tile two steps to the west of him to reach the middle of the maze. Go northwest to the lone cardboard box, then walk northeastward to the north-central room. Pick up
TM36
(
Sludge Bomb
) from the table, then head south. Battle the third Rocket Grunt to the south to exit the maze.

She had always followed
Giovanni
's orders, not caring if they were right or wrong, but has a change of heart after losing to you. She uses the machine next to her to reverse the two eastern spinner tiles. This creates a shortcut to bypass the maze, giving you a chance to visit the Pokémon Center before taking on the last few battles.
East-central room
The final Rocket Admin accuses you of spreading lies about
Team Rocket
disbanding to create confusion in their ranks. He aims to put a stop to this.

while the south exit leads to the next chamber. Go east in the fifth chamber. The sixth chamber has nine rocks; the east exit leads to a

Selphy is bored and fatigued from getting lost in the cave, and asks that you help her to her home. She automatically travels with you to the front door of her resort, where she dismisses you.
Resort Gorgeous
Now that she is back home,
Selphy
will occasionally want to see a certain species of Pokémon. If you present the correct Pokémon to her, she will have her butler, Sebastian, give you a random item as a reward. She will grow bored if you take too long (more than 250 steps taken), and wish to see a different Pokémon instead. The requested Pokémon may be any species that you have encountered.

Seven Island
Seven Island
Trainer Tower, 1F
Canyon Entrance
Sevault Canyon
Seven Island
is the southernmost of the
Sevii Islands
and the farthest from mainland
Kanto
. Its remote location has left the island virtually untouched, making it difficult to hike across. The town of
Seven Island
lies across a bridge from the main island, with a
battle facility
known as
Trainer Tower
farther to the north. South of town, the
Canyon Entrance
and
Sevault Canyon
open up to the sea, where the
Tanoby Ruins
are located.
Seven Island (Town)
The town of
Seven Island
holds little more than a Pokémon Center and Poké Mart. On the main bridge, an Ace Trainer offers to teach the move
Swords Dance
to a compatible Pokémon.
Trainer Tower
Trainer Tower
stretches from the north side of
town
to the the northernmost island, where the
battle facility
that gave the area its name stands tall.

Trainer Tower
Trainer Tower sets a goal for challengers of battling through eight floors of opponents to reach the rooftop as quickly as possible. There are four different types of battle in which challengers may participate:
Single Mode
,
Double Mode
,
Knockout Mode
, and
Mixed Mode
. Beating the record time for each mode earns a challenger a rare item, which can be obtained repeatedly. Unlike most battle facilities, a challenger's Pokémon are not healed between battles, though recovery items like
Revives
and
Potions
may be used. If necessary, challengers can return to the entrance to heal their party at the Pokémon Center, though this will waste more time in comparison to using items. Battles do not award
experience
or money, and the levels of the opposing Trainers' Pokémon match that of the player's highest-leveled party Pokémon.

Sevault Canyon
is a long, narrow valley leading southward to the ocean. The canyon seems to serve as a training ground for elite Trainers, while being guarded by equally skilled Pokémon Rangers. A small cave known as
Tanoby Key
is located on the valley's north side. The
Tanoby Ruins
lie to the south.

Tanoby Key
The

is a small cave in the northwest part of the canyon. The chamber houses seven pits in the earth, along with several boulders.
Trainer Tips!
1.
Use
Strength
to move the north-central boulder (↑4) northward to the first pit.
2.
Move the northwest boulder (→1, ↑2, ←3) to the northwest pit, and the northeast boulder (←1, ↑2, →3) to the northeast pit.
3.
Move the southwest boulder (←1, ↑2) to the southwest pit, and the southeast boulder (→1, ↑2) to the southeast pit.
4.
Move the remaining southwest boulder (↑3, ←1) to the west-central pit, and the remaining southeast boulder (↑3, →1) to the east-central pit.
Once each pit is occupied by a boulder, the earth shakes as a mysterious rumble echoes somewhere far away.
The Chansey Dance
The lone building in
Sevault Canyon
belongs to a man and his
Chansey
. Speak to him to learn that the man loves to dance, and even offers you a chance to join in. If you accept his offer, dancing the Chansey Dance heals all of your Pokémon to full health. Lucky!
Tanoby Ruins
The
Tanoby Ruins
consist of a group of seven islets scattered near the southern edge of
Seven Island
. Each of these small islands holds one of the
Tanoby Chambers
. According to a Ruin Maniac, these ruins have been around for more than 1,500 years.

Tanoby Chambers
The

Tanoby Key
reveals their true purpose, serving as a home to the
Unown
