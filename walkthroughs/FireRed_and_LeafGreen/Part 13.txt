Cinnabar Island
Cinnabar
is a large island to the southwest of mainland
Kanto
, between Routes
20
and
21
. The
Cinnabar Lab
, where researchers have developed a way to revive ancient Pokémon, stands to the west. A broken-down building known as
Pokémon Mansion
is located on the island's northwest side. The
Cinnabar Gym
can be found to the northeast, but is currently locked up tight.

Meeting Room
Time for a Trade
In the Meeting Room, two of the three people are looking to trade. The old man offers to trade his
Electrode
for a
Raichu
, and the woman offers her
Tangela
for a
Venonat
. Electrode can be evolved from
Voltorb
but are rare in the wild. Tangela only makes its home in one area and is difficult to find.
R-and-D Room
In the Research-and-Development Room, speak to the Super Nerd. This
Move Tutor
offers to teach
Metronome
to a compatible Pokémon. When used, Metronome executes a randomly selected move.
Testing Room
Time for a Trade
In the Testing Room, one of the Scientists is willing to trade his
Seel
for a
Ponyta
. As Seel would have been a common sight in the
Seafoam Islands
, it is likely that you have caught one already, potentially making this trade less useful than others.

Fossil Regeneration
The Scientist near the back wall runs the
fossil
regeneration procedure. Speak to him to hand over the
Helix Fossil
,
Dome Fossil
, or
Old Amber
. The procedure takes a moment to complete, so leave the room and return a short time later to receive the ancient Pokémon. The Helix Fossil and Dome Fossil become
Omanyte
and
Kabuto
, respectively; both are
Rock
/
Water
Pokémon that swam the primordial seas. The Old Amber becomes the
Rock
/
Flying
Aerodactyl
, a terror of the prehistoric skies.

Pokémon Mansion
The
Pokémon Mansion
is the decrepit, burned-down former home of a famous Pokémon researcher. The building uses several hidden switches to lock and unlock doors, and Burglars prowl the ruins for valuable items. A series of
journal entries
can be found scattered around the mansion that describe the birth and escape of
a genetically-engineered Pokémon
.

CINNABAR ISLAND POKéMON GYM
LEADER: BLAINE
The Hot-Headed Quiz Master!
The
Cinnabar Gym
specializes in
Fire-type
Pokémon. Fire-type moves are super effective against
Bug
-,
Grass
-,
Ice
-, and
Steel-type
Pokémon, while Fire-type Pokémon are weak to
Ground
-,
Rock
-, and
Water-type
moves. When playing with fire there is always the chance of getting
Burned
, so be sure to bring some
Burn Heals
. The
Gym Leader
enjoys riddles and has equipped his Gym with machines that display a quiz when examined. When each question is answered correctly, the door to the next room unlocks. This allows challengers to reach the Gym Leader sooner, but gives up the rewards of defeating his Gym Trainers.

After the battle,
Blaine
awards you the

, which gives your Pokémon a slight
Special Attack
and
Special Defense
boost during battle and enables the use of
Waterfall
in the field. He also gives you
TM38
(
Fire Blast
) as a prize.
Set Sail for the Sevii Islands!
When you leave the Gym, you find
Bill
waiting outside. A friend of his has invited him to visit
One Island
, part of an island chain far to the south of the
Kanto
mainland. He is on his way there now, and decides to invite you along, as well. Decline his offer at first and he will wait for you inside the Pokémon Center. His friend's ship has not yet arrived, so take a moment to prepare as PC services on these remote islands will be unavailable. Speak to him to board the ferry for the
Sevii Islands
!
