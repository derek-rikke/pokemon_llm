in the heart of the city and redeem their winnings at the Prize Corner next door. The
Celadon Gym
stands on a hill in the southwest part of town.

The tall building in the north part of town is

1F
Speak to the elderly woman on the first floor to receive a cup of
Tea
, a healthier alternative to the usual
drinks
. It's not meant for Pokémon consumption, however, so hold onto it for now.
3F
On the third floor,
Game Freak
's game designer promises a
reward
for showing him your completed
Pokédex
.
The Amazing Eevee
To further this goal of completing the Pokédex, leave an empty slot in your party and follow the path behind the Pokémon Center to find a break in the trees. Enter the mansion through the back door and climb to the top floor to obtain an
Eevee
. This Pokémon's unique genetic makeup allows it to evolve into one of several different forms. Exposure to a
Water Stone
,
ThunderStone
, or
Fire Stone
will cause it to evolve into
Vaporeon
,
Jolteon
, or
Flareon
, respectively. Any one will make a useful addition to your team, as they can cover your
first Pokémon
's weakness. These
stones
can only be purchased in the nearby Department Store.
Celadon Department Store
The
Celadon Department Store
is the largest shop in
Kanto
. Nearly any item a Trainer could want can be found here.
2F
The Trainer's Market is found on the second floor. Everyday items like
Great Balls
and
Super Potions
are offered here.

who offers to teach

to a compatible Pokémon. This move retaliates from any physical hit with double the damage taken.
4F
Wise Man Gifts is located on the fourth floor. The
stones
that cause certain Pokémon to evolve can be purchased here. Be sure to pick up a

or two, as they are useful for running from wild Pokémon.

Celadon Gym
Celadon Gym
CELADON CITY POKéMON GYM
LEADER: ERIKA
The Nature Loving Princess!
The
Celadon Gym
specializes in
Grass-type
Pokémon. This type is generally vulnerable against
Fire
-,
Ice
-,
Flying
-,
Poison
-, and
Bug-type
attacks. Most Pokémon inside are also part-Poison, which leaves them exposed to
Psychic
moves, as well.
Water
,
Rock
, and
Ground
Pokémon are best kept on the sidelines. Grass Pokémon tend to harass their target with status ailments, so it is a good idea to bring healing items like
Antidote
,
Parlyz Heal
, and
Awakening
. Once the first few Gym Trainers have been defeated, have a Pokémon use
Cut
on one of the small trees to reach the clearing with the Gym Leader.

After the battle,
Erika
awards you the
Rainbow Badge
, which ensures obedience from all Pokémon up to level 50 and enables the use of
Strength
in the field. She also gives you
TM19
(
Giga Drain
) as a prize.
Fickle Fortune
Stop by the restaurant on the city's south side and talk to the man near the back wall. A string of bad luck at the slot machines has cost him all of his money, so he has no more use for his
Coin Case
and gives it to you.
Shady Dealings
Several
Team Rocket
Grunts can be seen loitering around the city. Next door to the restaurant, there are workers organizing the transport of 2,000 Pokémon every month to the Game Corner to be used as prizes. Numbers like that mean money, and are sure to draw Team Rocket's attention. Whatever the group may be involved in, as one of the workers points out, it surely has nothing to do with a hidden switch in the Game Corner.
Game Corner
Game Corner
Location of hidden coins
The prizes offered next door are expensive, so it will require a large number of coins to receive all of them. Coins may be purchased at the counter in sets of 50 for
$
1,000 and sets of 500 for
$
10,000. Others can be obtained by speaking with other patrons, and even more can be found dropped on the ground.

A Secret Switch?
Nothing seems out of the ordinary at first, but there is something off about the
man in black
who is fixated on a poster on the back wall. When you try to speak to him, he picks a fight with you. Defeat his two Pokémon and he retreats, leaving the poster unguarded. Inspect it to find a secret switch hidden underneath; press this switch and a hidden door opens to the right, revealing a secret stairway leading underground.

The

certain item
being located somewhere in
Celadon
that can identify the ghosts of
Pokémon Tower
. It would not be surprising for
Team Rocket
to have acquired an item as valuable as this, so be sure to take it back if you can find it!

meant to thwart any intruders; step on one of these arrow tiles to be sent spinning until you reach a stopper tile.
Enter the maze and follow the spinner tiles to the stopper tile in the northwest. Backtrack carefully to reach an
X Speed

On this first visit to B4F, it is only possible to reach the two rooms on the west side. Pick up the
Max Ether
on a table to the south, then visit the northwest room. Pick up
TM49
(
Snatch
) and battle the nearby Rocket Grunt. Talk to him afterward and he drops the
Lift Key
, which operates the elevator in the southeast part of the complex.
Climb back up to B2F and make your way through the larger maze again to reach the elevator. Take it down to B4F.

Exit the elevator and go west to reach a

VS Giovanni
Both
Giovanni
's
Onix
and
Rhyhorn
take massive damage from
Grass
and
Water
attacks. His
Kangaskhan
takes serious damage only from
Fighting
moves. Avoid using attacking moves if Onix uses
Rage
, as this boosts its
Attack
every time it takes damage.

Giovanni
cannot believe that he lost, but acknowledges that you raise your Pokémon with great care. He says that a child like you could never understand his goals, then he and most of the other Rockets disappear. Be sure to pick up the
Silph Scope
that he leaves behind. Ride the elevator to B1F and battle one last Rocket Grunt on the way out.
The Key to the City
With the cup of
Tea
from
Celadon Mansion
, you can pass through
Saffron City
on the way back to
Pokémon Tower
. Enter Saffron's west gate and the guard sees that you have a beverage. If you give it to him, he shares it with the other three guards which now allows you to reach the city from any direction. Travel eastward through the city to return to
Route 8
and
Lavender Town
.

attacks, but are vulnerable to
Dark-type
attacks. The spirits can be relentless, so it may be useful to bring a supply of Repels and Poké Dolls along to avoid them as much as possible. There are still many possessed Channelers here as well, so be sure to bring some Super Potions along.

Rival Battle 5
By this point,
Blue
has assembled a team that includes
Grass
,
Fire
, and
Water
Pokémon to cover his weaknesses. His
first Pokémon
takes the place of either
Exeggcute
,
Growlithe
, or
Gyarados
, whichever matches its type. His
Pidgeotto
can still harass Grass- and
Bug-type
Pokémon with
Gust
, and strike first with
Quick Attack
. Exeggcute can induce
Sleep
with
Hypnosis
, so use
Awakenings
as necessary. Growlithe's
Ember
can deal a decent amount of damage and may cause a
Burn
. As Blue's only fully-evolved Pokémon, his Gyarados has the biggest offensive presence so be sure to take it down quickly.
Kadabra
takes super effective damage from Bug-,
Ghost
-, and
Dark-type
moves, but physical moves will wear it down as well. Blue's first Pokémon has grown to level 25 and learned some new moves, but it should not be too much to handle. Use super effective moves to send your rival packing and continue up the tower.

A Channeler in the middle of the fifth floor has not been possessed and maintains a healing area with her white magic. When a Trainer enters this protected zone, all of their Pokémon will be fully healed. A
Cleanse Tag
can be found here, as well; when held by the lead Pokémon, it decreases the chance of encountering wild Pokémon by 33%. Battle another Channeler or two and grab the
Nugget
before taking the eastern stairs.
6F
Collect the
X Accuracy
to the south, then northward past three more Channelers. Grab the
Rare Candy
in your path and proceed to the south stairway. As you approach, the
ghost
attacks and the
Silph Scope
activates, revealing a level 30
Marowak
. Unfortunately, this spirit cannot be caught and must be defeated.

When the battle is over, the mother Marowak's spirit is calmed. Finally able to rest, she departs to the afterlife.
Climb the final stairway to the seventh floor.

Defeat the three Rocket Grunts and speak to
Mr. Fuji
. He thanks you for calming Marowak's spirit and asks that you accompany him to his home, the Volunteer Pokémon House, at the foot of the tower.
Mr. Fuji's house
Speak to
Mr. Fuji
to receive the
Poké Flute
as thanks. This instrument awakens any
sleeping
Pokémon who may hear its music. With this, you can finally wake the two
Snorlax
who have been blocking the way to southern
Kanto
. But first, head west to return to
Saffron City
and take on the next Gym.
