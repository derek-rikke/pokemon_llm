Elixir

TM25
(
Thunder

from the northeast corner of the northeast room. Continue westward to reach the final room.
VS Zapdos
Zapdos
is the last of the
legendary birds
that you will encounter. Use
Rock
- and
Ice-type
attacks to weaken it quickly, then follow up with
Grass
,
Flying
, and
Fighting
moves to wear its health down further. Like with
Articuno
and
Moltres
, it will be useful to cause status ailments like
Sleep
to increase the odds of catching it.

...
In the time it took to collect the seven other Badges, the Gym Leader of
Viridian Gym
has finally returned.
Giovanni
resumed his position as Gym Leader shortly after his defeat in
Saffron City
. The
Viridian Gym
specializes in
Ground-type
Pokémon.
Grass
-,
Water
-, and
Ice-type
attacks will be the most useful.
Flying-type
Pokémon are immune to Ground attacks and Flying moves will deal serious damage to the several
Fighting
Pokémon inside.
Psychic
moves will work wonders against
Poison-type
Pokémon.
Like the
Rocket Hideout
in
Celadon City
, the Viridian Gym also employs
spinner tiles
to confuse and disorient any challengers. Go north through the center room. Battle Ace Trainer Warren and Black Belt Takashi, so that Takashi walks away from the north wall. Return to the entrance and follow the spinner tiles north and west to reach the Gym Leader.

After the battle,
Giovanni
awards you the
Earth Badge
, which ensures obedience from all Pokémon, regardless of level. As a prize, he also gives you
TM26
(
Earthquake
), a TM he claims to have made when he first acted as Gym Leader. He seems remorseful of his actions, and officially disbands
Team Rocket
before disappearing.
The Path to the Summit
Having won all eight Gym Badges, the next destination is the
Indigo Plateau
, far to the northwest. The elite Trainers there are tough, but before you can challenge them, you must first survive a grueling cave known as
Victory Road
. Gather your strongest Pokémon team with access to
Surf
and
Strength
, and visit a Poké Mart to replenish your supply of Potions and Poké Balls.
