Cerulean City
Having cleared the
Sevii Islands
, there is only one place left to explore:
Cerulean Cave
, a mysterious place on the northwest edge of
Cerulean City
. To get there, visitors must
Surf
southward from
Route 24
.
Cerulean Cave

Cerulean Cave, 2F
Cerulean Cave, B1F
Cerulean Cave
is a mysterious cavern located in the northwest part of
Cerulean City
. Only the most powerful Trainers who have entered the
Hall of Fame
are allowed to enter due to the powerful wild Pokémon inside. The sprawling cave network is unforgiving, so be sure to prepare well. Pack the
Super Rod
and stock up on
Ultra Balls
, and bring the
Master Ball
as well. It is here that the
genetically-engineered Pokémon
from
Cinnabar Island
's
Pokémon Mansion
fled after escaping the facility.

VS Mewtwo
Not only is
Mewtwo
the strongest Pokémon around, but it has already reached level 70. As a
Psychic-type
Pokémon, it is vulnerable to
Bug
-,
Ghost
-, and
Dark-type
attacks. The legendary Pokémon can restore its health repeatedly with
Recover
, so inflicting status ailments are a must. Not only will this make Mewtwo easier to catch, but
Sleep
,
Freezing
, and
Paralysis
will prevent it from replenishing its HP. It will not let itself be caught easily, so either use the
Master Ball
when the battle begins or be prepared to go through more than a few
Ultra Balls
.

A Legend On the Loose
With
Celio
's Network Machine fully upgraded, there have been recent sightings of a mysterious, quick-footed Pokémon. This Pokémon has found its way here from the neighboring
Johto
region and begins
roaming
across
Kanto
. The creature that appears will have a type advantage against your
first partner Pokémon
.
Before trying to track it down, be sure to save your progress
. Due to
a glitch
,
Entei
and
Raikou
will permanently disappear if they are able to use
Roar
to escape. If you have not yet used the
Master Ball
, doing so when the battle begins is the easiest way to avoid this scenario; players may also use a
soft reset
to reload the game from the last save. Otherwise, players would need to play through a new game to make the beast reappear.
Tracking a Beast
The Pokémon now races across the vast
Kanto
region, but it is not necessary to search every area for it. A simple strategy involves spraying on a Repel.
Trainer Tips!
1.
If necessary, visit a Poké Mart to purchase a few
Repels
or
Super Repels
.
2.
Fly
back to
Viridian City
and go north to
Route 2
.
3.
The Pokémon in the first party position must have a level between 11 and 49. Choose a Repel variant and spray it on. This chases off any wild Pokémon with a lower level, leaving the high-level beast the only thing left to encounter.
4.
Wander through the tall grass until the beast appears. If not, enter and exit the gate to
Viridian Forest
to reload the map and change the Pokémon's location.
It will attempt to flee as soon as the battle begins, so be sure to use
Abilities
like
Arena Trap
or moves like
Mean Look
to block its escape.

Lorelei
Lorelei
has swapped out her
Slowbro
in favor of

Signal Beam
, respectively.

Electric-type
Pokémon work well against her team, but be careful of

and

Both of

have evolved into

, but their low
Special Defense
leaves them vulnerable to
Fire
and
Water
moves. His three other Pokémon now know
Rock Slide
, making this a hazardous battle for
Flying
Pokémon.
Psychic
attacks are still useful, and Psychic Pokémon only need to fear his Steelix's

Rival Battle 9
Blue
has swapped out his
Pidgeot
and
Rhydon
for
Heracross
and
Tyranitar
. Most of his Pokémon also have moves to cover their weaknesses. Heracross takes massive damage from
Flying
attacks, but avoid using Flying-type Pokémon as it can fight back with
Rock Tomb
. Similarly, Tyranitar suffers massive damage from
Fighting
moves, but Fighting-type Pokémon will be vulnerable to
Aerial Ace
, a Flying-type attack. His
Arcanine
,
Gyarados
, and
Exeggutor
are much the same as before. Arcanine can counter
Rock
Pokémon with
Iron Tail
, and Gyarados can retaliate against
Electric
Pokémon with
Earthquake
.
Charizard
,
Blastoise
, and
Venusaur
all have ways to counter their weaknesses, so be wary of sending in a Pokémon that may seemingly have the advantage at first.
