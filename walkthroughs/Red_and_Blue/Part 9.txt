Celadon Mansion
The tall building in the north part of town is
Celadon Mansion
. On the third floor,
Game Freak
's game designer promises a
reward
for showing him your completed
Pokédex
.
The Amazing Eevee
To further this goal of completing the Pokédex, leave an empty slot in your party and follow the path behind the Pokémon Center to find a break in the trees. Enter the mansion through the back door and climb to the top floor to obtain an
Eevee
. This Pokémon's unique genetic makeup allows it to evolve into one of several different forms. Exposure to a
Water Stone
,
ThunderStone
, or
Fire Stone
will cause it to evolve into
Vaporeon
,
Jolteon
, or
Flareon
, respectively. Any one will make a useful addition to your team, as they can cover your
first partner Pokémon
's weakness. These
stones
can only be purchased in the nearby Department Store.
Celadon Department Store
The
Celadon Department Store
is the largest shop in
Kanto
. Nearly any item a Trainer could want can be found here.
2F
The Trainer's Market is found on the second floor. Everyday items like

Celadon Gym
Celadon Gym
CELADON CITY POKéMON GYM
LEADER: ERIKA
The Nature Loving Princess!
The
Celadon Gym
specializes in
Grass-type
Pokémon. This type is generally vulnerable against
Fire
-,
Ice
-,
Flying
-,
Poison
-, and
Bug-type
attacks. Most Pokémon inside are also part-Poison, which leaves them exposed to
Psychic
moves, as well.
Water
,
Rock
, and
Ground
Pokémon are best kept on the sidelines. Grass Pokémon tend to harass their target with status ailments, so it is a good idea to bring healing items like
Antidote
,
Parlyz Heal
, and
Awakening
. Once the first few Gym Trainers have been defeated, have a Pokémon use
Cut
on one of the small trees to reach the clearing with the Gym Leader.

After the battle,
Erika
awards you the
Rainbow Badge
, which ensures obedience from all Pokémon up to level 50 and enables the use of
Strength
in the field. She also gives you
TM21
(
Mega Drain
) as a prize.
Fickle Fortune
Stop by the restaurant on the city's south side and talk to the man near the back wall. A string of bad luck at the slot machines has cost him all of his money, so he has no more use for his
Coin Case
and gives it to you.
Shady Dealings
Several
Team Rocket
Grunts can be seen loitering around the city. Next door to the restaurant, there are workers organizing the transport of 2,000 Pokémon every month to the Game Corner to be used as prizes. Numbers like that mean money, and are sure to draw Team Rocket's attention. Whatever the group may be involved in, as one of the workers points out, it surely has nothing to do with a hidden switch in the Game Corner.

Locations of hidden coins
Confronting the Rocket
The prizes offered next door are expensive, so it will require a large number of coins to receive all of them. Coins may be purchased at the counter in sets of 50 for
$
1,000 each. Others can be obtained by speaking with other patrons, and even more can be found dropped on the ground.

A Secret Switch?
Nothing seems out of the ordinary at first, but there is something off about the
man in black
who is fixated on a poster on the back wall. When you try to speak to him, he picks a fight with you. Defeat his two Pokémon and he retreats, leaving the poster unguarded. Inspect it to find a secret switch hidden underneath; press this switch and a hidden door opens to the right, revealing a secret stairway leading underground.

The

is a secret underground complex used by the group as their base of operations. Rumors point to a
certain item
being located somewhere in
Celadon
that can identify the ghosts of
Pokémon Tower
. It would not be surprising for
Team Rocket
to have acquired an item as valuable as this, so be sure to take it back if you can find it!

Enter the maze and follow the spinner tiles to the stopper tile in the northwest. Backtrack carefully to reach a
Nugget

B4F (Northwest)
On this first visit to B4F, it is only possible to reach the two rooms on the west side. Pick up the
HP Up
on a table to the south, then visit the northwest room. Pick up
TM02
(
Razor Wind
) and battle the nearby Rocket Grunt. Talk to him afterward and he drops the
Lift Key
, which operates the elevator in the southeast part of the complex.
Climb back up to B2F and make your way through the larger maze again to reach the elevator. Take it down to B4F.
B4F (Southeast)
Exit the elevator and go west to reach an
Iron
. Defeat the last two Rocket Grunts and the electronic door that they are guarding opens. Step inside to confront the Rocket boss.
VS Giovanni
Both
Giovanni
's
Onix
and
Rhyhorn
take massive damage from
Grass

Water
attacks. His
Kangaskhan
takes serious damage only from
Fighting
moves. Avoid using attacking moves if Onix or Kangaskhan use
Rage
, as it boosts their
Attack
every time they take damage.

Giovanni
cannot believe that he lost, but acknowledges that you raise your Pokémon with great care. He says that a child like you could never understand his goals, then he and most of the other Rockets disappear. Be sure to pick up the
Silph Scope
that he leaves behind. Ride the elevator to B1F and battle one last Rocket Grunt on the way out.
Over/Under
If you still have an extra
drink
on hand, you can pass through
Saffron City
on the way back to
Pokémon Tower
. Enter Saffron's west gate and the guard sees that you have a beverage. If you give it to him, he shares it with the other three guards which now allows you to reach the city from any direction. Travel eastward through the city to return to
Route 8
and
Lavender Town
.
If not, take the
Underground Path
back to
Route 8
and continue eastward.

The
Ghost
Pokémon of

are immune to
Normal

Fighting-type
attacks, but as they are also
Poison
type, they are vulnerable to
Psychic
attacks. The spirits can be relentless, so it may be useful to bring a supply of Repels and Poké Dolls along to avoid them as much as possible. There are still many possessed Channelers here as well, so be sure to bring some Super Potions along.

Rival Battle 5
By this point,
Blue
has assembled a team that includes
Grass
,
Fire
, and
Water
Pokémon to cover his weaknesses. His
first partner Pokémon
takes the place of either
Exeggcute
,
Growlithe
, or
Gyarados
, whichever matches its type. His
Pidgeotto
still poses little threat, as it has no
Flying-type
moves and those it has are fairly weak. Exeggcute can induce
Sleep
with
Hypnosis
, so use
Awakenings
as necessary. Growlithe's
Ember
can deal a decent amount of damage and may cause a
Burn
. His Gyarados has the biggest offensive presence with
Hydro Pump
, so be sure to take it down quickly.
Kadabra
takes super effective damage only from
Bug
moves, but physical moves will wear it down as well. Blue's first Pokémon has grown to level 25 and learned some new moves, but it should not be too much to handle. Use super effective moves to send your rival packing and continue up the tower.

Climb the final stairway to the seventh floor.

Mr. Fuji's house

Mr. Fuji
to receive the
Poké Flute
as thanks. This instrument awakens any

Kanto
. But first, head west to return to
Saffron City
and take on the next Gym.
