Follow the trail to the northwest to reach a

in the tall grass. Return to the entrance, and this time head eastward. Battle the first
Bug Catcher
on the east side of the forest, then continue north to fight the second. Grab the nearby
Antidote
and turn west to the tall grass. Zigzag westward through the trees to reach a signpost. Explore the dead-end path to the southeast to get a
Potion
, then continue westward. Defeat one last Bug Catcher to reach the northern edge of the forest. Leave the gate to re-emerge on
Route 2
and continue north to
Pewter City
.
Pewter City
Pewter City

Calling All Challengers
The local
Gym Leader
is looking for challengers, and the kid blocking the city's east exit will escort you to the Gym if you try to leave. This is the first city to sell
Potions
, so stock up at the Poké Mart before taking up the challenge.
Pewter Museum of Science
The
Pewter Museum of Science
is located on the north side of the city. It hosts a wide range of artifacts and exhibits, with a focus on
fossil
excavation and space exploration. Admission to the main building is
$
50 for a child's ticket. The smaller building next door is closed to the public.
Pewter Gym

PEWTER CITY POKéMON GYM
LEADER: BROCK
The Rock Solid POKéMON Trainer!
The
Pewter Gym
specializes in
Rock-type
Pokémon.
Grass
and
Water
attacks are the most effective here, as they deal serious damage to the Gym Trainer's Pokémon, and are doubly effective against
Brock
's
Rock
/
Ground
Pokémon. Though
Geodude
and
Onix
resist
Fire
attacks, their poor
Special
stat allows
Charmander
's
Ember
to inflict a decent amount of damage anyway. For an added power boost, consider raising Charmander to level 16, when it
evolves
into
Charmeleon
. An alternative method would be to raise a
Caterpie
until it evolves to
Butterfree
, then have it learn
Confusion
on Level 12. If Brock's Onix uses
Bide
, spend the next few turns using stat-lowering moves, as any damage it endures during this time will be returned for twice as much!

After the battle,
Brock
awards you the
Boulder Badge
, which gives your Pokémon a slight
Attack
boost during battle and enables the use of
Flash
in the field. He also gives you
TM34
(
Bide
) as a prize.
With the
Pewter Gym
defeated, your next destination is
Cerulean City
to the east. Visit the Poké Mart for Potions, Poké Balls, and an
Escape Rope
or two for the cave up ahead. Once you are ready, head east to reach
Route 3
.
