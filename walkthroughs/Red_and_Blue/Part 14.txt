Power Plant
The
Power Plant
is an industrial complex that was abandoned years ago, though some of the machinery still works. Many forgotten items can be found lying around, but beware: some are actually
Voltorb
and
Electrode
that only look like items.

In Search of Power
Pass through the entrance room to get a
Carbos
. Continue in a clockwise direction to find a second "item", a
Voltorb
. The large, central room is a dead-end with both a Voltorb and
Electrode
waiting to surprise an unsuspecting visitor. Travel south to the exterior wall and pick up
TM33
(
Reflect
) in the south-central room. Collect
TM25
(
Thunder
) in the southeast room, then follow the narrow hallway northward. Grab the
Rare Candy
and
HP Up
from the northeast room. Continue westward to reach the west-central room.
VS Zapdos
Zapdos
is likely the second of the
Legendary birds
that you will encounter. Use
Rock
- and
Ice-type
attacks to weaken it quickly, then follow up with
Grass
,
Flying
, and
Fighting
moves to wear its health down further. Like with
Articuno
, it will be useful to cause status ailments like
Sleep
to increase the odds of catching it.

In the time it took to collect the seven other Badges, the Gym Leader of
Viridian Gym
has finally returned.
Giovanni
resumed his position as Gym Leader shortly after his defeat in
Saffron City
. The
Viridian Gym
specializes in
Ground-type
Pokémon.
Grass
-,
Water
-, and
Ice-type
attacks will be the most useful.
Flying-type
Pokémon are immune to Ground attacks and Flying moves will deal serious damage to the several
Fighting
Pokémon inside.
Psychic
moves will work wonders against
Poison-type
Pokémon.
Go north past the three Gym Trainers to reach a
Revive
. Continue on and battle the next two Trainers, so that the second walks away from the north wall. Return to the entrance and follow the spinner tiles north and west to reach the Gym Leader. Take down his
Rhydon
quickly, as two of its moves cause an
instant knockout
if they hit!

After the battle,
Giovanni
awards you the
Earth Badge
, which ensures obedience from all Pokémon, regardless of level. As a prize, he also gives you
TM27
(
Fissure
), a TM he claims to have made when he first acted as Gym Leader. He seems remorseful of his actions, and officially disbands
Team Rocket
before disappearing.
The Path to the Summit
Having won all eight Gym Badges, the next destination is the
Indigo Plateau
, far to the northwest. The elite Trainers there are tough, but before you can challenge them, you must first survive a grueling cave known as
Victory Road
. Gather your strongest Pokémon team with access to
Surf
and
Strength
, and visit a Poké Mart to replenish your supply of Potions and Poké Balls. A third Legendary Pokémon can be found deep inside.
