Cinnabar Island
Cinnabar Island
Cinnabar
is a large island to the southwest of mainland
Kanto
, between Routes
20
and
21
. The
Cinnabar Lab
, where researchers have developed a way to revive ancient Pokémon, stands to the west. A broken-down building known as
Pokémon Mansion
is located on the island's northwest side. The
Cinnabar Gym
can be found to the northeast, but is currently locked up tight.

Meeting Room
Time for a Trade
In the Meeting Room, two of the three people are looking to trade. The old man offers to trade his
Electrode
for a
Raichu
, and the woman offers her
Tangela
for a
Venonat
. Electrode can be evolved from
Voltorb
but are rare in the wild. Tangela only makes its home in one area and is difficult to find.
R-and-D Room
In the Research-and-Development Room, speak to the Scientist in the back to receive
TM35
(
Metronome
). When used, Metronome executes a randomly selected move.
Testing Room
Time for a Trade
In the Testing Room, one of the Scientists is willing to trade his
Seel
for a
Ponyta
. As Seel would have been a common sight in the
Seafoam Islands
, it is likely that you have caught one already, potentially making this trade less useful than others.

Fossil Regeneration
The Scientist near the back wall runs the
fossil
regeneration procedure. Speak to him to hand over the
Helix Fossil
,
Dome Fossil
, or
Old Amber
. The procedure takes a moment to complete, so leave the room and return a short time later to receive the ancient Pokémon. The Helix Fossil and Dome Fossil become
Omanyte
and
Kabuto
, respectively; both are
Rock
/
Water
Pokémon that swam the primordial seas. The Old Amber becomes the
Rock
/
Flying
Aerodactyl
, a terror of the prehistoric skies.

Pokémon Mansion
The
Pokémon Mansion
is the decrepit, burned-down former home of a famous Pokémon researcher. The building uses several hidden switches to lock and unlock doors, and Burglars prowl the ruins for valuable items. A series of
journal entries
can be found scattered around the mansion that describe the birth and escape of
a genetically-engineered Pokémon
.

LEADER: BLAINE
The Hot-Headed
Quiz Master!
The
Cinnabar Gym
specializes in
Fire-type
Pokémon.
Water
,
Rock
, and
Ground-type
moves will be the most effective.
Grass
-,
Bug
-, and
Ice-type
Pokémon should avoid battling for now. When playing with fire there is always the chance of getting
Burned
, so be sure to bring some
Burn Heals
. The
Gym Leader
enjoys riddles and has equipped his Gym with machines that display a quiz when examined. When each question is answered correctly, the door to the next room unlocks. This allows challengers to reach the Gym Leader sooner, but gives up the rewards of defeating his Gym Trainers.

Pallet Town
Having now explored nearly all of the
Kanto
region, it is a good time to tie up any loose ends, the most important of which is the
Power Plant
. To get there, fly back to
Cerulean City
and travel east to revisit Routes
9
and
10
.
Route 10
To reach the
Power Plant
, use
Surf
to follow the river southward past the
Rock Tunnel
entrance. It is only a short distance away, with a single PokéManiac outside the building.
