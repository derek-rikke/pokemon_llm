. To get there, visitors must
Surf

Cerulean Cave, B1F
Cerulean Cave
is a mysterious cavern located in the northwest part of
Cerulean City
. Only the most powerful Trainers who have entered the
Hall of Fame
are allowed to enter due to the powerful wild Pokémon inside. The sprawling cave network is unforgiving, so be sure to prepare well. Pack the
Super Rod
and stock up on
Ultra Balls
, and bring the
Master Ball
as well. It is here that the
genetically-engineered Pokémon
from
Cinnabar Island
's
Pokémon Mansion
fled after escaping the facility.

Walk up onto the rocky ridge and climb up the ladder to the second floor.
2F
Loop around to the east, grab the
PP Up
, and take the ladder in the northeast corner back down to the first floor.
1F
Go down the stairway and use
Surf
to swim westward. Grab the nearby
Max Elixer
and climb onto the rocky ridge to the northwest. Grab the
Nugget
and climb up the ladder.
2F
Head east through the maze to find a
Full Restore
, then continue on to find the next ladder.
1F
Go west and surf across the water for another
Full Restore
, then climb back onto the central rocky ridge. Follow the southern tunnel to the next ladder on the western ridge.
2F
Pick up the
Ultra Ball
, then follow the winding trail to the ladder in the northwest corner.
1F
Take the next ladder down to the lower floor.
B1F
Head northeast from the ladder and grab the
Max Revive
from the smaller rocky ridge. Turn around and follow the tunnel to the southwest, then climb up onto the central ridge to reach another
Ultra Ball
. Use
Surf
to swim along the water and cut across the rocky ridge in the northeast. Surf southward to find
Mewtwo
, alone on its island. Be sure to save the game before interacting with it, as there is only one chance to catch it.
VS Mewtwo
Not only is
Mewtwo
the strongest Pokémon around, but it has already reached level 70. As a
Psychic-type
Pokémon, it is only vulnerable to
Bug-type
attacks. Bug moves are fairly weak, and so a better way would be to use the
Legendary birds
, as they are the closest to Mewtwo's equals in terms of power. The Legendary Pokémon can restore its health repeatedly with
Recover
, so inflicting status ailments are a must. Not only will this make Mewtwo easier to catch, but
Sleep
,
Freezing
, and
Paralysis
will prevent it from replenishing its HP. It will not let itself be caught easily, so either use the
Master Ball
when the battle begins or be prepared to go through more than a few
Ultra Balls
.

With the

defeated and
Cerulean Cave
cleared, the only thing left to do is to complete the
Pokédex
. There are 151 different Pokémon species that have been discovered so far, leaving plenty of training left to do!
