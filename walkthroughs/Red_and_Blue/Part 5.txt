.
Gym Badges, Explained
The northwest house belongs to a man who offers to explains the effects of the eight
Gym Badges
. Half of them give a slight power boost to a respective stat, while the other half ensure a Pokémon's
obedience
during battle. The first five unlock the use of field moves.

Bike Shop
It would be great to get a
Bicycle
from the
Bike Shop
in the southwest part of town, but they cost a whopping
$
1,000,000! It is not possible to carry that much money, so it looks like you are stuck traveling on foot for now.
Breaking, Entering
The house in the northeast is currently blocked off by a police officer. It seems that
Team Rocket
has broken into the home and stolen
a valuable item
from its residents. Nothing can be done to remedy this at the moment, so set your sights on the Gym instead.
Cerulean Gym
Cerulean Gym
CERULEAN CITY POKéMON GYM
LEADER: MISTY
The Tomboyish Mermaid!
The
Cerulean Gym
specializes in
Water-type
Pokémon.
Grass
- and
Electric-type
moves are best here, while
Fire
,
Ground
, and
Rock
Pokémon may struggle.
Pikachu
is a good choice to bring along, and
Oddish
and
Bellsprout
can be found on the nearby
Route 24
.
Take out
Misty
's
Staryu
quickly to move on to her
Starmie
. Her second Pokémon is both
stronger
and
faster
than Staryu, making its
BubbleBeam
especially painful to vulnerable Pokémon. Use Pikachu's
ThunderShock
, or Grass moves like
Vine Whip
and
Absorb
, to deal serious damage and make quick work of it.

After the battle,
Misty
awards you the
Cascade Badge
, which ensures obedience from all Pokémon up to level 30 and enables the use of
Cut
in the field. She also gives you
TM11
(
BubbleBeam
) as a prize.
Rival Battle 3
When you head toward
Route 24
,
Blue
appears and taunts you as usual before drawing you into another battle. He leads with his
Pidgeotto
, so start off with
Electric
- and
Rock-type
attacks. His
Abra
is a sitting duck as
its only move
does not deal any damage, making a good opportunity to earn experience for your lower-leveled Pokémon.
Rattata
's
Quick Attack
lets it move first regardless of its
Speed
and
Hyper Fang
can inflict a good bit of damage, so try to take it out quickly. His
first partner Pokémon
is more of a threat now that it has learned a damaging move that matches its type. This
same-type attack bonus
boosts its power by 50%. Avoid pitting your own first Pokémon against his, or your Pokémon could take serious damage.

Sea Cottage
An Unfortunate Turn
The
Sea Cottage
belongs to
Bill
, a famous Pokémon researcher. When you step inside, it seems like Bill must be away, until you speak to the Pokémon inside. His latest experiment has gone awry and combined his DNA with that of a Pokémon! He needs your help, so once he has stepped into the machine, inspect his PC to activate a program to undo the change and return him to normal. As a token of gratitude, he gives you an
S.S. Ticket
, which grants access to the
luxury cruise ship
currently docked in
Vermilion City
to the south.
Bill's Favorite Pokémon
Before leaving the cape, you can exit and re-enter the cottage and inspect Bill's PC to view some of
his favorite Pokémon
. This adds
three
new
pages
to your Pokédex.
Cerulean City
Justice, Served
Once you return to
Cerulean City
, the officer blocking the burgled house has stepped aside, allowing you to enter. Inside are obvious signs of a break-in, like muddy footprints and overturned planters. There is even a large hole in the wall! Step out through the hole to find and confront the thief.

Pokémon Day Care
The house on the hill is the
Pokémon Day Care
. The old man inside will raise one Pokémon at a time while you are away. A Pokémon left here will gain one
experience point
for every step taken. If you bought the
Magikarp
near
Mt. Moon
, this is a good way to raise it. The downside is that he will make every decision, so he may end up deleting a move you would like to keep. He charges
$
100, plus another
$
100 for every new level, to return a Pokémon.
