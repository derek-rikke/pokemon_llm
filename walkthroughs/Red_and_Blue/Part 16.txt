Hall of Fame
Indigo Plateau
Indigo Plateau
The
Indigo Plateau
serves as the capital for the
Pokémon League
in the
Kanto
region. This is where the Trainers who have defeated all eight
Gym Leaders
battle against the
Elite Four
and the
Champion
. The entrance hall houses a Pokémon Center and a Poké Mart, allowing challengers to prepare themselves and their Pokémon for the gauntlet ahead. The
Elite Four
is a group of talented Pokémon Trainers second only to the Champion in terms of power, and must be fought in succession with no break. These five battles will not be easy, but challengers who bring their strongest Pokémon and a healthy supply of Potions and Revives may finally find themselves in the
Hall of Fame
.

Elite Four
Battle 1
Lorelei's room
The first member of the Elite Four is
Lorelei
, a master
Ice-type
Trainer. Ice-type Pokémon are weak to
Fire
-,
Rock
-, and
Fighting-type
moves, while Ice-type moves are super effective against
Grass
-,
Flying
-,
Ground
-, and
Dragon-type
Pokémon. Her
Jynx
is notably her only Pokémon that is not
Water
type. Due to her Pokémon's dual typings,
Electric
moves are the most useful against Lorelei's frigid forces.

Battle 2
Bruno's room
The second member of the Elite Four is
Bruno
, a master
Fighting-type
Trainer. Fighting-type Pokémon are weak to
Flying
- and
Psychic-type
moves, while Fighting-type moves are super effective against
Normal
-,
Rock
-, and
Ice-type
Pokémon. A pair of
Onix
round out his team, so
Grass
and
Water
moves are also helpful.
Slowbro
and
Starmie
may be especially useful here, as their
Water
/
Psychic
typing helps to counter each opposing Pokémon.

Battle 3
Agatha's room
The third member of the Elite Four is
Agatha
, a master
Ghost-type
Trainer. Ghost-type Pokémon are only vulnerable to Ghost-type moves, while Ghost-type moves are super effective against Ghost-type Pokémon.
Normal
- and
Fighting-type
moves will have no effect. Take out her two
Gengar
as soon as possible, or risk the effects of
Sleep
and
Poisoning
. As all of her Pokémon are also part
Poison
,
Ground
- and
Psychic-type
attacks are the best ways to calm Agatha's spirits.

Defeating Agatha unlocks the door to the fourth room.
Battle 4
Lance's room
The fourth and final member of the Elite Four is
Lance
, a master
Dragon-type
Trainer and leader of the Elite Four. Dragon-type Pokémon are vulnerable only to Dragon- and
Ice-type
moves, and resists
Grass
-,
Fire
-,
Water
-, and
Electric-type
attacks. All of Lance's Pokémon have a draconic appearance, but only three are Dragon type. Use
Ice Beam
to tear through his two
Dragonair
and his
Dragonite
. Due to its secondary
Flying
type, his
Aerodactyl
also takes serious damage from Ice moves, but Water moves are also effective. His
Gyarados
takes massive damage from Electric moves, so use
Thunderbolt
to take it down. With their Ice and Electric attacks,
Articuno
and
Zapdos
are some of the best choices to help slay Lance's dragons.

With the Elite Four defeated, the door to the Champion's room is unlocked. Take a moment to prepare your Pokémon now, as you will be drawn into battle immediately upon entering the next room. Only one person stands between you and the title of Champion!
Champion
Champion's room
Blue
defeated the Elite Four before you even set foot in
Victory Road
, and now the title of Indigo League Champion rests with him. The first half of his team will always consist of
Pidgeot
,
Alakazam
, and
Rhydon
. The second half changes depending on his
first partner Pokémon
.
Electric-type
attacks terrorize his Pidgeot and
Gyarados
(or
Blastoise
), so a crackling
Thunderbolt
will send them reeling. A strong
Water
Pokémon can wash away his Rhydon and
Arcanine
(or
Charizard
) with
Surf
. His
Exeggutor
(or
Venusaur
) cannot survive long in extreme heat or cold, so hitting it with
Flamethrower
or
Ice Beam
will do the trick. The most annoying opponent may be his Alakazam due to its
Recover
move; its
Defense
is fairly low, so hit it with a physical move to put an end to its games.

The eight
Gym Leaders
are defeated, the
Elite Four
have fallen, and the title of

But the adventure is not over just yet. Once you find yourself back in
Pallet Town
, use
