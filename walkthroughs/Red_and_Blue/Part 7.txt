Treasure Hunting
Visit the
gate
on the route's east side and speak to the Scientist. He happens to be one of
Professor Oak
's
aides
and has been tasked with evaluating your
Pokédex
progress. If you have caught at least 30 different species, he rewards you with the
Itemfinder
. Using this machine reveals any items that may be hidden nearby.
Time for a Trade
The boy near Oak's aide wants a
Nidorino
, and is willing to trade his
Nidorina
for one. Both Pokémon can be obtained elsewhere without trading, but Nidorina may be harder to find for some Trainers
R
than others
B
.
Diglett's Cave
Diglett's Cave
is a long tunnel that spans nearly the whole region, linking
Route 11
to the east side of
Route 2
. Like the name implies, the only Pokémon that can be found here are
Diglett
and its evolved form,
Dugtrio
.

Time for a Trade
Visit the northeast house and speak to the man inside. He is looking to get an
Abra
, and is willing to trade his
Mr. Mime
to get one. Abra can be found near
Cerulean City
, though their tendency to
Teleport
makes them difficult to capture. Mr. Mime is a unique Pokémon that cannot be found anywhere else.
Let There Be Light
Use
Cut
and continue south to reach the
gate
, where another of
Oak
's
aides
is waiting for you. As a reward for capturing at least 10 different species, he gives out
HM05
(
Flash
). This move makes it easier to navigate the dark interior of
certain underground areas
.
From here, you may want to revisit
Viridian City
to get
TM42
(
Dream Eater
) from the man near the pond.
Pewter City
Pewter Museum of Science
On this latest visit to
Pewter City
, you can use
Cut
to clear the small tree on the northeast hill to reach the employee-only area of the
museum
. Speak to the Scientist standing next to the table to receive the
Old Amber
. There are Scientists elsewhere who have apparently developed a way to regenerate Pokémon from ancient bits of DNA like this.
Fork in the Road
The next step is to return to
Cerulean City
. There are two ways to get back there: either travel east through
Mt. Moon
again, or hike back through
Diglett's Cave
and head north from
Vermilion City
. Once back in Cerulean City, make your way to the east side of town and use
Cut
to clear the small tree and continue eastward.

Route 9
is a rocky, uneven mountain road that links
Cerulean City
