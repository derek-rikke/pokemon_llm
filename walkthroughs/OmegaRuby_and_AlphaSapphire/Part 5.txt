Mauville City, 3F
Mauville City
is located in central
Hoenn
, situated between Routes
110
,
111
,
117
, and
118
. The site has recently undergone a large-scale renovation led by city founder and local
Gym Leader
Wattson
, so that it would more closely mimic its sister city,
Lumiose
, in the
Kalos
region. The mostly-indoor city now features many specialty shops and a courtyard on the first floor, the upscale Mauville Hills apartments—open only to residents—on the second, and a recreational rooftop area.

A Familiar Face
When you enter the city, you spot a familiar face.
Wally
is visiting the city with his uncle, but he's not interested in shopping. Instead, he rushes off to challenge the
Mauville Gym
!
Courtyard
Continue north to reach the central courtyard. The Pokémon Center and Poké Mart are located here. Grab the hidden
X Defense
behind Square Tower, and talk to the Backpacker for a
Globe
decoration.
Stop by the Pokémon Center and talk to the bald man. His name is
Giddy
, and he has a scintillating story to tell. After this, he teaches you the
Speed O-Power
. Strike up another conversation and endure his second story to learn the
Critical O-Power
. He leaves at this point, sparing you from further musings. These powers can be activated through the
PSS
in the
PlayNav
app. After Giddy leaves, four other men will appear here, one after the other:
the Hipster
,
the Bard
,
the Trader
, and
the Storyteller
. After meeting them all, the five return to their apartment upstairs; visit them there once you gain access to Mauville Hills to get the final O-Power.
The Poké Mart features two clerks; the first offers the usual necessities, while the second offers a selection of
TMs
. If you can afford the
$
10,000 price tag,
TM78
(
Bulldoze
) will be a big help at the local Gym! Before leaving, speak to the girl to receive
TM58
(
Sky Drop
).
Northeast District
TV Mauville
TV Mauville
produces every program that airs on the
BuzzNav
app. Inside, you can tour the studio, browse the gift shop, even sit behind the news desk and read the latest bulletin before it airs.
Battle Institute Hoenn
The
Battle Institute
is a place where powerful Trainers test their worth in a series of challenging battles. Only
Pokémon Champions
can participate, so you'll need to return later. It's worth stopping by though, as a man inside hands you a
Vs. Recorder
. This device lets you document and share certain battles over the
PSS
feature of the
PlayNav
app.
Inverse Battle Stop
At the
Inverse Battle Stop
, you can challenge Proprietor
Inver
to an
Inverse Battle
once per day. Like the name implies, all type match-ups in this kind of battle are reversed. A Pokémon's weaknesses are treated as resistances, and all resistances and immunities are treated as weaknesses.
Inver's three Pokémon
are all level 20, until you become the Champion. Defeat him to receive
your reward
, which changes depending on your performance. He will even triple your reward if none of your Pokémon's
HP
falls into the red.
Rydel's Cycles
Rydel's Cycles
is located near the city's east exit. Spotting your dirty
Running Shoes
, the shop owner,
Rydel
, realizes that you've done a lot of traveling. He offers you a free bicycle, and gives you the choice between two models. The
Mach Bike
is faster and is able to ride up
muddy slopes
, which is useful for exploring places like
Granite Cave
. The
Acro Bike
is slower which allows for more precise control and the ability to perform
tricks
. After choosing a bike, you can speak to Rydel at any time to swap it for the other model.
Southeast District
Ultimate Move Studio
The
Ultimate Move Studio
stands to the southwest of Rydel's Cycles. The man at the counter can teach an ultimate move to any fully-evolved starter Pokémon. However, it must share a strong bond with its Trainer.
Sceptile
and the quiet
Grass
Pokémon can learn
Frenzy Plant
, while
Blaziken
and the blazing
Fire
Pokémon can learn
Blast Burn
, and
Swampert
and the restless
Water
Pokémon can learn
Hydro Cannon
.
Pledge Move Dojo
South of the Move Studio is the
Pledge Move Dojo
. This Move Tutor teaches a special move to any starter Pokémon or its relatives.
Grass-type
Pokémon like the
Treecko
family can learn
Grass Pledge
,
Fire-type
Pokémon like the
Torchic
family can learn
Fire Pledge
, and
Water-type
Pokémon like the
Mudkip
family can learn
Water Pledge
. Using these moves in the same turn in a
Double
or
Triple Battle
will raise their power from 80 to 150, and activate additional effects.
Types Involved
Description
Creates a sea of fire where all non-
Fire
Pokémon lose 1/8 of their max
HP
every turn for four turns
Creates a rainbow that doubles the likelihood of a move's additional effect(s) for four turns
Creates a vast swamp that reduces the opponent's
Speed
by 50% for four turns
Song and Sword Move Academy
The third shop on the left is the
Song and Sword Move Academy
, but it's vacant. The owner is at the Crooner's Café in the southwest part of town.
Mauville Food Court
The
Mauville Food Court
can be found near the city's south exit.
Hungry Trainers
won't hesitate to battle you in order to sit down and eat their meal from one of the three restaurants. Two of the eateries are so popular that people line up for hours, so you can only order from the Village Sub Combo for now. By finishing a course at just the right time, you are
rewarded
with a valuable item; by doing this while defeating all opposing Trainers, you win an additional prize.
Village Sub Combo
One order costs
$
1,000 and takes five turns to make. As you sit down to wait, other hungry Trainers will challenge you to
Single Battles
for your chair! Finish up one of the battles at just the right time to win a free
Nugget
. Defeat all opponents in exactly five turns to win a random Berry—
Figy
,
Aguav
,
Mago
,
Wiki
, or
Iapapa
—as well.
Magnemite Croquettes
Return after collecting all eight Gym Badges and the line for Magnemite Croquettes will have finally cleared out. An order costs
$
5,000 and takes six turns to make. Once again, you're given a buzzer and told to wait, and hungry Trainers again challenge you for your seat, but this time you must fight them off in
Double Battles
! Finish the course to earn a
Pearl String
; defeating all Trainers in time earns you a
Metal Powder
as well.
Mauville Ramen Bowl
Mauville Ramen Bowl is so popular that the crowd won't thin out until after you complete the post-game
Delta Episode
. A meal costs
$
10,000 and takes eight turns to make. This time, you'll need to defend your seat in a series of
Triple Battles
. Rumor has it that there is a certain Trainer hanging around here that really does not want to lose to you for some reason. Finishing your meal at the right time earns you a
Big Nugget
, while defeating all opposing Trainers also wins you a
Deep Sea Tooth
OR
or
Deep Sea Scale
AS
.
After clearing the first seven battles within seven turns, you will be challenged by the strongest Trainer in the restaurant:
Fare Prince
Trencherman.
Southwest District
Crooner's Café
Speak to the barista to receive
TM48
(
Round
). The balding owner of the Song and Sword Move Academy also lounges here, hoping to teach a new move to a
Keldeo
or
Meloetta
. These Pokémon are not native to the
Hoenn
region, but he would be happy to teach
Secret Sword
and
Relic Song
, respectively, if you happen to obtain them.
Game Corner
The Game Corner has recently gone out of business, and the former owner can be found outside. He isn't too upset, but does have some leftover prizes to hand out. Agree to take them off his hands to receive a
Treecko Doll
,
Torchic Doll
, and
Mudkip Doll
.
Northwest District
Narcissus Mirror Shop
Many mirrors are on display at this fancy shop. According to the owner, her mirrors were all collected by her husband and she is reluctant to sell any of them. However, she mentions
one of them
having a connection to the legendary
Tornadus
,
Thundurus
, and
Landorus
...
Ritzy Ribbon Retail
Ritzy Ribbon Retail
offers a selection of expensive Ribbons designed especially for "Pokémon That Aim for a Higher Rank". Any Ribbons purchased here will be given to your lead Pokémon.
PokéMilage Center
In the
PokéMileage Center
, a Gentleman will exchange your
Poké Miles
for items. His prices range from 10 to 1,000.
Pokémon Reflexology Services
The woman at
Pokémon Reflexology Services
offers to massage your lead Pokémon once per day, free of charge.
Wally's Challenge
When you approach the Gym, you find
Wally
and his uncle talking outside the building. He desperately wants to challenge the Gym, but his uncle has reservations. He challenges you to a quick battle to test his skills.

Defense
.
Mauville Gym
Mauville Gym
Mauville City Pokémon Gym
Leader: Wattson
The cheerfully electrifying man!
The
Mauville Gym
specializes in
Electric-type
Pokémon. While Pokémon of this type are only vulnerable to
Ground-type
attacks, the secondary types of the Pokémon inside make
Fire
and
Fighting
moves useful as well. Keep your
Flying
- and
Water
-Pokémon (except
Marshtomp
, due to its secondary
Ground
typing) on the sidelines for now. The Gym, split into two rooms, features several electrical barriers, with color-coded switches on the floor. Stepping on a switch alters the direction of all similarly-colored barriers, from vertical to horizontal and vice-versa.
Wattson
leads with his
Magnemite
, an
Electric
/
Steel
Pokémon. Though it is especially vulnerable to
Ground
moves, its
Sturdy
Ability prevents a one-hit knockout. It likes using
Thunder Wave
to paralyze the target, cutting its
Speed
and restricting its movement. Though his
Voltorb
's
Attack
is low, if left unchecked its
Rollout
move—a
Rock
attack—increases in power and can pose a danger to
Fire
Pokémon like
Combusken
. His third Pokémon,
Magneton
, likes to start with
Supersonic
to confuse its foe. All of his Pokémon know
Volt Switch
, a strong move that deals damage before the user switches out.

After the battle, Wattson awards you the
Dynamo Badge
, which ensures obedience of all Pokémon up to level 40 and enables the use of
Rock Smash
in the field. He also hands out
TM72
(
Volt Switch
) as a prize.
3F
Mauville's elevators lead to the second floor, but that floor is restricted to the tenants of Mauville Hills. However, the four staircases all lead to the rooftop, where everyone is free to enjoy the fresh air. A suited man will sell you a
Metronome
, and a young girl will give you a
Poké Toy
after assuring her that you love Pokémon. Keep running around the rooftop, and a man will eventually appear on the south side and hand you a
Nugget
.
Take the northeast stairs to the second floor to meet a Street Thug who is waiting for
Genesect
. It's not native to Hoenn, so he could be waiting here for a long time. If you happen to obtain one, he would surely be happy to see it.
