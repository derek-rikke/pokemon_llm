The Scuffle
Deep inside the woods, you come across a researcher from
Devon Corporation
, a company based in
Rustboro City
. After explaining that he is looking for a
Shroomish
, he is suddenly confronted by a member of
Team Magma
OR
/
Team Aqua
AS
. The thug had planned to ambush the worker when he left the woods, but grew too impatient for that. Defeat him in battle and he flees the scene, but not before hinting that his friends are up to something in Rustboro. The grateful researcher gives you the
Exp. Share
, which distributes
experience points
to all Pokémon traveling with you, as thanks. He then heals your Pokémon, and rushes off to Rustboro after realizing what his attacker wanted.
Tricky Times Ahead
Continue on your way to the north side of
Route 104
. After you exit the woods,
another Grunt
on recon duty steps out of the trees to the east, reporting to her superior about their failure. She reaffirms her continued investigation of a form of energy that the team had recently detected. Whatever the group's plans are, it seems clear that a conflict is brewing in Hoenn. Be sure to be on your guard!
Pretty Petal Flower Shop
The
Pretty Petal Flower Shop
is run by three sisters. The eldest sister teaches all visitors how to grow Berries. The middle sister hands out the
Wailmer Pail
when you first speak to her. The youngest sister will hand out one random Berry from a group of eight every day.

Rustboro City
is the third largest city in
Hoenn
. Each of the buildings were constructed with stone, giving the city an old-fashioned feeling. The
Pokémon Trainers' School
,
Devon Corporation
headquarters, and
Rustboro Gym
are all located here.

The Poké Mart is the first building you reach, and who else steps out of it but May/Brendan. She/He marvels at the size of the city, then dashes off to challenge the local Gym.
Cutter's House
Stop by the Cutter's house next to the Pokémon Center. When the city was expanding, he taught his Pokémon a move to help clear the surrounding land of trees. He no longer needs his
HM01
(
Cut
), and gives it to you. In the field, Cut may be used to clear away prickly trees.
Devon Corporation
Devon Corporation
is headquartered in a large stone building in the northwest part of town. The company is responsible for manufacturing many of the items Trainers rely on every day, including several variations of Poké Ball and medicine. Only authorized personnel are allowed past the first floor.

Time for a Trade
The Rustboro Gym beckons, but before you step inside, visit the house to the east. Inside is a boy who is looking to trade his
Makuhita
for a
Slakoth
. Makuhita is a strong
Fighting-type
Pokémon that will be a big help inside the Gym. This one is even holding an
X Attack
to sweeten the deal.
Rustboro Gym
Rustboro Gym
Rustboro City Pokémon Gym
Leader: Roxanne
The Rock-loving honor student!
The
Rustboro Gym
specializes in
Rock-type
Pokémon. Use
Grass
and
Water
(
Fighting
is also good for
Nosepass
) moves to deal serious damage, and avoid battling with
Fire
-,
Bug
-, or
Flying-type
Pokémon. The Gym doubles as a Fossil museum, and has an impressive array of exhibits on display. The Gym Leader,
Roxanne
, greets you near the entrance. She is eager to see how you fare against her, and takes her place at the back of the building. As hers is the first Gym in the
Hoenn League
, this graduate of the
Pokémon Trainers' School
has opted for a layout that gives novice Trainers a chance to avoid her subordinates and challenge the Gym Leader directly. Use
Leer
or
Tail Whip
to soften up Roxanne's rock-solid Pokémon. Her
Geodude
has the
Sturdy
Ability, which prevents it from being defeated in one hit, so chip away at its health before striking with super-effective moves.

Rusturf Tunnel
Rusturf Tunnel
Rusturf Tunnel
was a construction project by
Devon Corporation
that aimed to link
Rustboro City
and western
Hoenn
to the rest of the region. The tunnel was nearly complete when Devon's president,
Mr. Stone
, realized that the work was disturbing the local
Whismur
population. The project was canceled, though only a small bit of debris,
easily cleared
, remained to hinder travel.

, head back to the Devon Corporation building in

On the third floor, the company president introduces himself as
Mr. Stone
