Relic Recovery!
The unending sandstorm seems to have uncovered two treasures from the ancient past in the desert's northeast corner. The
Root Fossil
and
Claw Fossil
belong to two species that once lived in the primordial ocean. The researchers at
Devon Corporation
back in
Rustboro
are able to revive any Fossil they receive into a long-lost Pokémon. The Root Fossil becomes the
Rock
/
Grass
Lileep
, while the Claw Fossil turns into the
Rock
/
Bug
Anorith
. Removing either one from their resting place causes the other to sink into the sand, so choose carefully!
Desert Ruins
The unusual arrangement of stones to the south is known as the
Desert Ruins
. It is believed to mark the resting place of a legendary Pokémon. But with the entrance sealed, you won't be able to investigate until later.
Back to Petalburg City
Now that you've claimed your fourth Badge and combed the desert for treasure, your next stop is
Petalburg City
. The city is far to the southwest, but there are several ways by which to return there.
Backtrack through
Mt. Chimney
and
Jagged Pass
to
Lavaridge
. Speak to May/Brendan outside the Gym to quickly travel with your friend on her/his way back to Petalburg.
Head northwest around the volcano to
Fallarbor Town
, then south through
Meteor Falls
to return to Rustboro.
Go south from the desert to
Mauville City
, then west to
Verdanturf Town
. Cut through
Rusturf Tunnel
to return to Rustboro.
If you decide not to accompany your friend to the city, be sure to stop by
Devon Corporation
on the way to have the researchers there revive your Fossil Pokémon.

Petalburg City Pokémon Gym
Leader: Norman
A man in pursuit of power!
The
Petalburg Gym
, which specializes in
Normal-type
Pokémon, is styled as a traditional dojo with multiple rooms. Each room has a single Trainer who uses special items to gain the upper hand in battle. The sign on each door gives a clue to the strategy of the Trainer in the room behind it. The first two rooms beyond the lobby are labeled "Speed" and "Accuracy". The three rooms farther on are named "Zero Reduction", "Defense", and "Recovery". The final two rooms before the Gym Leader are labeled "Strength" and "One-Hit KO". A minimum of three Gym Trainers must be defeated to reach the Gym Leader.
Fighting
types like
Machop
and
Makuhita
will give you the upper hand here.

In the final room, your father has been waiting for you. Now that you have earned four other Badges, he is now ready to accept your challenge.
Norman
leads with the first of his two
Slaking
. Slaking usually leads with
Yawn
; if you switch out your Pokémon to keep it from falling
asleep
, your next Pokémon will be safe from attack. This is due to Slaking's Ability,
Truant
, which prevents it from attacking every other turn. However, his
Vigoroth
has no such problem. When it appears in battle, use
Protect
or
Detect
to avoid serious damage from its
Retaliate
move, which doubles in power if its ally was defeated a turn earlier. His third Pokémon's
Chip Away
move ignores the target's stat changes, like
Defense
boosts from moves like
Bulk Up
or
Iron Defense
. While
Ghost
Pokémon are usually unaffected by Normal-type attacks, and vice-versa, Norman's entire team can use
Feint Attack
to deal serious damage to such Pokémon. However, if you have any Pokemon that know the move
Protect
, Norman's two
Slaking
can be easily defeated due to their
Truant
ability.

Afterwards, your father awards you the
Balance Badge
, which ensures the obedience of all Pokémon up to level 60 and enables the use of
Surf
in the field. He also hands you
TM67
(
Retaliate
) as a gift. Norman then leads you outside, where the two of you run into
Wally
and his father as they are visiting the city. After a short discussion about Wally and his improving health, his father gives you
HM03
(
Surf
) as thanks for helping the young Trainer. In battle,
Surf
is a strong
Water-type
attack that hits all adjacent Pokemon; in the field, it allows you to cross bodies of water. Norman says that you should now be able to handle the stronger opponents on
Hoenn
's east coast, beyond
Route 118
. The two Trainers set off for
Mauville City
to prepare, and the two fathers have another short discussion.
Route 118

Route 118

Surf's Up!
When you're ready to cross the river, approach the beach and use
Surf
. Hop on your seafaring Pokémon's back to glide across the water. While Surfing, it is impossible to use the field moves
Cut
,
Strength
, or
Rock Smash
; however,
several
other
moves
are allowed. The
Dowsing Machine
can't be used while crossing the waves, but you can use an
Escape Rope
or a fishing rod while doing so. Most Pokémon will let you travel twice as fast as on foot, the same speed as the
Acro Bike
. Set sail with a
Sharpedo
and you will be able to move at triple the speed, on par with that of the
Mach Bike
; however, the high speed makes it too difficult to use a fishing rod.
Get Good with a Good Rod
The Fisherman on the river's eastern bank believes that Good Rods are really good. Agree with his statement to receive your very own
Good Rod
, a mid-level fishing rod that can catch even more kinds of Pokémon than the
Old Rod
.
Gabby and Ty
After being interviewed by
Gabby and Ty
on the south side of
Route 111
, the intrepid news team can be found searching for their next story on the eastern bank of
Route 118
's river. Accept their challenge to another
Double Battle
and be sure to give them a great interview when the dust settles!
Meet up with Steven
As you leave the beach, you are noticed by
Steven
. He hasn't seen you since your first meeting in
Granite Cave
, and is pleased to see how much you have grown as a Trainer. He wonders if you will raise Pokémon of all types, or only your favorite one. He turns to leave, but the two of you suddenly heard a Pokémon cry out. As the two of you scan the horizon for the source, you see the legendary Pokémon
Latias
OR
/
Latios
AS
headed your way! There seems to be trouble brewing, and Steven asks that you come along to help. The two Trainers climb onto the Pokémon's back and soar off to the south.
Southern Island
Southern Island, exterior
Southern Island
is a tiny, remote island in the southern ocean. Widely considered a mirage, the island is surrounded by a mysterious veil that makes approach impossible for mere humans. This same anomaly also prevents anyone from
Flying

Teleporting

Steven gets an odd feeling about the place immediately upon arrival, like he's walking through an illusion. He recounts an old tale about the two Pokémon that live on the island, which are believed to guard some secret about

. He wonders if something dangerous could be here because of that. As you approach the forest up ahead, a strange voice calls out to you with a telepathic message:
(Those whose memories fade seek to carve them in their hearts…)

Shocked by their loss, the villainous pair will flee the island. Once they are gone, Steven will restore your team to full health. Since Latios
OR
/Latias
AS
is grateful for your aid, it will join your party. You may need to send a party Pokémon to the PC to make room for the
Dragon
/
Psychic
type. The legendary Pokémon even brings its own
Mega Stone
, the
Latiosite
OR
/
Latiasite
AS
, along with it! Steven gives you the
Mega Bracelet
Key Item. The
Key Stone
embedded in it will allow you to temporarily
Mega Evolve
Pokémon equipped with the proper Mega Stone during battle. Mega Evolution may change a Pokémon's stats, Ability, or even type, often making them much more formidable for the rest of the battle. Now that you've chased off Team Magma
OR
/Team Aqua
AS
, you accompany Steven back to
Route 118
, where he leaves you to continue your journey.
Also, if you have an
Eon Ticket
, a key item that can be obtained through
StreetPass
, you can make a
return trip
to catch the other Eon Pokémon.
