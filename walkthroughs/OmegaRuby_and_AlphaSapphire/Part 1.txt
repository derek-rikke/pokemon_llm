Introduction
The player is immediately given a choice of several languages—English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, and Korean—in which to play. After the title screen, the resident researcher of the
Hoenn
region,
Professor Birch
, appears and introduces new Trainers to the Pokémon world. Meanwhile, the camera pulls back to reveal that his lecture is being shown on a device that the player is using in the back of a moving truck. As the truck proceeds to its destination, the player is shown a scenic view of the surrounding wilderness. The professor continues, asking the player to select both a gender and a name, which can be up to twelve characters long. With that done, the moving truck stops, and Birch sends the player off to begin their journey!
Home
The game begins
in the back of a moving truck
, as your family has just moved here from the far-off
Johto
region. Hop out of the truck to meet
Mom
and step inside your new home. Head upstairs to check out your room and set the clock. Return to the first floor and Mom excitedly calls you over to the TV; the current program just aired a segment about the
Petalburg Gym
, where your dad is the new
Gym Leader
. She then suggests visiting his friend, your new neighbor,
Professor Birch
. Welcome to Littleroot Town!
Littleroot Town
Littleroot Town
Littleroot
is a quaint little town nestled on the lush southern edge of the
Hoenn
mainland. There are only three buildings here; your home,
Professor Birch
's home, and the professor's Pokémon Laboratory, where he conducts research on Pokémon distribution, in the south.

Save the Professor!
When you first reach the area, you find
Professor Birch
being chased around by a wild
Poochyena
! His Bag has fallen out of his reach, and he pleads with you for help. Choose one of the three Pokémon from the Poké Balls inside the professor's Bag, and use it to scare off his attacker.

Treecko
has the most weaknesses of the trio, with five:
Fire

attacks. It and its evolutions excel in
Special Attack

The
Fire-type
Torchic
is great when battling

Steel-type
Pokémon, but is vulnerable to
Water
-,
Rock
-, and
Ground-type
moves. It and its evolved forms focus on

Special Attack
. As it grows, it gains a secondary

type.
The
Water-type
Mudkip
has an advantage when facing
Fire
-,
Rock
-, and
Ground-type
Pokémon, but may struggle against
Grass
and
Electric
attacks. It and its evolutions specialize in
Attack
. As it grows, it gains a secondary Ground type; this protects it from Electric attacks, but leaves it especially vulnerable to Grass moves.
Littleroot Town
Birch's Lab
After scaring off the wild Pokémon, Birch invites you back to the Lab. As thanks for rescuing him, he happily lets you keep the young Pokémon. He then encourages you to visit May/Brendan on
Route 103
for tips on how to be a Pokémon Trainer. If you ever get lost, he advises using the AreaNav on your
PokéNav Plus
to find your way. When your Pokémon needs a rest, head back home and visit with Mom to have her restore it to full health.
AreaNav
The PokéNav Plus is a device that can make use of four different apps, though you have only one at this point. AreaNav displays a map of Hoenn, with locations darkened until you visit them. Up to five features can be unlocked in this app.
Places
lists detailed info on each location.
Pokémon
shows the different species you have encountered in each area; the image for those you have only seen will be grayed out.
Trainers
displays old foes that are itching for a rematch, and provides info on their strategy, favorite Pokémon, and even their team.
Secret Bases
shows the location of your Secret Base, as well as the bases of others.
Berries
displays the locations of Berries you have planted, and how long it has been since you planted them.
Oldale Town
Oldale Town
Oldale Town
is the first settlement in the region to feature a
Pokémon Center
and a
Poké Mart
. Pokémon Centers are essentially hospitals where creatures can be restored to perfect health. The PC on the counter is always available for Trainers to organize their Pokémon. Poké Marts offer a wide range of items for sale, from Potions to Poké Balls.
Route 102
leads off to the west, while
Route 103
runs northward.

Rival Battle 1
Cross through the tall grass to meet up with
your
rival
, who challenges you to a friendly battle after spotting your new Pokémon. The opposing Pokémon will always have a type advantage against your own. Avoid using moves of your own type, as they will deal less damage than normal, and use
Normal-type
moves instead. Remember to use Potions if the battle isn't going your way!

After the battle, follow May/Brendan back to

's Lab. Inside, the professor gives you a handy gadget: the
Pokédex
! This high-tech encyclopedia instantly records information on any Pokémon you see or catch. In addition, his child gives you ten
Poké Balls
to start you off on your journey. Now that you have received some Poké Balls, they can be purchased at all Poké Marts in the region. Buying ten Poké Balls at once, at any location, also earns you a bonus
Premier Ball
.
Meet up with Mom
As you go to leave Littleroot, Mom comes over to ask if you've met the professor. She is proud that you have your own Pokémon, but asks that you don't push yourself too hard. She reminds you that you can always come back home to rest.
Route 101
DexNav
May/Brendan catches up with you as you re-enter
Route 101
. She/He has a gift for you from the professor; a new update for your
PokéNav Plus
, the DexNav! This handy app helps you tell whether or not you've caught all of the Pokémon that live in each area. Early on, DexNav only shows Pokémon that can be found on land. Once you obtain a fishing rod, it also displays Pokémon that can be found while fishing. Once you can use
Surf
in the field, it also shows Pokémon that can be found while crossing bodies of water.
Catching and Seeing Pokémon
Pokémon that you've seen but not caught will appear as shadows on DexNav, and will be listed as "Seen" in your Pokédex. Pokémon that you have caught will be shown in full color on DexNav. Tap one of these full-color Pokémon to activate Detector Mode and search for more specimens!
Checking Progress
Tap the DexNav display to view a message that gives a better idea of your progress.
Message
Progress
"There are no wild Pokémon in this area."
No Pokémon can be caught.
"There are still Pokémon in this area that you have not caught!"
More than one Pokémon remains to be caught.
"Nearly complete!"
Only one more Pokémon remains to be caught.
"Good job! You've caught them all!"
Every available Pokémon has been caught through regular encounters.
"Amazing! Fantastic! You caught every possible Pokémon in this area!"
Every available Pokémon has been caught, including all hidden Pokémon that appear in the field.
As you catch more Pokémon, special marks will appear in the screen's upper-right-hand corner. A bronze trophy means that you've caught all available Pokémon through a single method, via tall grass, surfing, fishing, or by sneaking up on hidden Pokémon. A platinum trophy means that you've caught all possible Pokémon for that area.
Hidden Pokémon
Now that you have some Poké Balls and the DexNav upgrade, you're all set to start catching wild Pokémon. They can be found by simply moving through tall grass, but sometimes a hidden Pokémon will appear that you can sneak up on! Continue along
Route 101
until May/Brendan points out a Pokémon's tail in the tall grass. When you see one of these hidden Pokémon in the field, or one is detected in Detector Mode, sneak up on it by pushing lightly on the Circle Pad. When you approach, a magnifying glass will appear on the Touch Screen; tap it to open Detector Mode. It turns out that this Pokémon, a
Poochyena
, is on level 5 and knows one of the
Elemental Fang
moves. The move it has depends on your first partner Pokémon;
Thunder Fang
for
Treecko
,
Ice Fang
for
Torchic
, and
Fire Fang
for
Mudkip
.
Detector Mode
Detector Mode
shows information about hidden Pokémon and how close they are to you. If used repeatedly to find a particular kind of Pokémon, you're more likely to encounter a hidden Pokémon with exceptional traits. These Pokémon may have great
potential
, or may know
certain moves
they may not otherwise learn. They may also have
Hidden Abilities
, hold special items, or be found at much higher levels than other Pokémon in the area. An exceptional Pokémon is marked by an exclamation point next to any part of its summary on the Detector Mode screen. Repeatedly battling the same kind of Pokémon raises the Search Level for each species; a higher Search Level means that more details are displayed on the summary screen.
Detecting a Pokémon doesn't guarantee a battle, however. Three main actions can cause a search to fail:
Moving too fast, instead of sneaking up on a hidden Pokémon.
Taking too long to find a hidden Pokémon.
Attempting another search immediately after the last one. Try to take at least 20 steps between searches.

Meet up with Dad
As you reach the center of town, you see your father,
Norman
, talking with a Schoolkid about a battle they just had. The kid leaves, and Dad invites you inside the Gym to talk. He is surprised that you've made it this far from home, but is excited for you to become a Pokémon Trainer like him. A sickly boy named
Wally
soon enters, and explains that he will be staying with relatives in nearby
Verdanturf Town
in the hopes that the clean air will do him good. But he is afraid of becoming lonely there, and asks for help in catching a Pokémon to take along. Norman asks that you go with him, and loans him his
Zigzagoon
and a
Poké Ball
. Wally leads you back to
Route 102
, where he successfully catches a
Ralts
.
PlayNav
Back at the Gym, Wally can't thank you enough for helping him catch his very own Pokémon. Before he leaves, he happily upgrades your
PokéNav Plus
with the PlayNav app. Now you can play games with your Pokémon with
Pokémon-Amie
, train them up in
Super Training
, and connect with other Trainers around with world with the
Player Search System
!
Your father then gives you some advice: to become a strong Trainer, challenge Gym Leader
Roxanne
in
Rustboro City
before moving on to the other Gym Leaders. Though Norman is also a Gym Leader, he will not accept your challenge until you have earned four
Badges
.
