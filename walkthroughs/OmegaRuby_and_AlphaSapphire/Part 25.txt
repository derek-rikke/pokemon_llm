Battle Resort
The grand
Battle Resort
was built with the goal of allowing Trainers to enjoy every kind of Pokémon battle. The many shops, attractions, and skilled Trainers found on this tropical island make it an ideal destination for Trainers seeking to improve their battling skills.

Catch up with Wally
Stepping off the S.S. Tidal, you're surprised to find your friend
Wally
standing on the pier. The little guy is bursting with excitement and can't wait to explore everything that this tropical paradise has to offer—especially now that you're here to enjoy it with him!
Receive a Mega Stone

hands you before hurrying after Wally.
Lower level
Learn of the Battle Maison
As you and Wally step onto the island, you catch the attention of a Collector. He can tell that the two of you are not here as spectators, and suggests checking out the
Battle Maison
, the big building in the center of the island. He also hands each of you a
Vs. Recorder
, if you haven't yet obtained one. Wally runs off to explore, leaving you to do the same.
Meet the Judge
Visit the Pokémon Center and speak to the Ace Trainer who stands in the corner. People call him the
Judge
, as he has the power to judge a Pokémon's individual potential for greatness. Show the Judge any Pokémon, and he'll tell you whether or not it has the potential to become the mightiest of its species.
Pokémon Day Care Annex
Go east from the Pokémon Center to reach the Day Care Annex. It operates the same way as the Day Care Center on
Route 117
. Between the two facilities, four individual Pokémon can be raised—or two pairs of Pokémon can be bred—at the same time.
Inside, the rather pompous Lady needs some money to help her out of a jam. If you decide to lend her
$
100, she rewards you with
TM87
(
Swagger
).
Talk Bikes with a Triathlete
Visit the beach on the island's southeast side to find a Bike-riding Triathlete staring out to sea. Chat up this obvious Bike enthusiast, and he'll be blown away by the Bike you got from Rydel's Cycles. It seems he's been thinking about buying one of Rydel's Bikes for himself. If you also spoke with a certain Hex Maniac in
Route 111
's central desert and a particular Bird Keeper on
Route 119
, who were both equally impressed by your Bikes, then return to
Mauville
and pay Rydel a visit. You'll find that he will now let you keep both the Mach Bike and Acro Bike at the same time. No more swapping Bikes, and you can now reach two valuable TMs in the
Hoenn Safari Zone
and one at the
Mirage Cave (north of Fallarbor Town)
!
Meet Looker
Head up the beach on the island's east side to find a man in a trench coat doubled over near the shore. This coat-wearing castaway is known as
Looker
, a tough detective who solved many mysteries and crimes around
Lumiose City
before leaving the distant
Kalos
region for new adventures. He looks all washed up, but you don't get the chance to help him as he is rescued by an all-too-eager Beauty.
Battle Resort Masters
These five Trainers wander the island, each one specializing in a certain Pokémon type. Combined with the eight Gym Leaders, Elite Four, and Champion, you can now face master Trainers for each of the 18 Pokémon types! Continue going north (right) along the beach to meet the first of the Battle Resort masters. This is the
Fairy-type
master, Fairy Tale Girl Josephine, and though she's still young she has already mastered the delicate intricacies of battling with
Fairy-type
Pokémon.
Custodian's Cabin
Visit the small cabin on the island's northeast shore to meet the Battle Resort's elderly custodian. He has collected a number of valuable items that people have carelessly left around the island, and invites you to take whatever you like. Be sure to check the sparkling spot as well to obtain another Mega Stone, a
Gengarite
.
Meet the Move Tutors
Head westward (right) from the custodian's cabin and you'll soon meet the island's
Poison-type
master, Rich Boy Antoin. Whether you battle him or not, continue on to the west side of the island, where several Move Tutors have set up shop. In exchange for a few Battle Points, these four Move Tutors will teach your Pokémon a wide variety of moves. Battle Points can be earned at the Battle Maison, and by doing well at the Battle Institute in
Mauville
.
In addition, the island's resident
Grass-type
master, Aroma Lady Carnation, stands ready for battle on the nearby shore.
Mid-level
Scale the Hill
You've come full-circle, and are now back near the Pokémon Center. There's nowhere else to go but up! Climb the stairway to find the Battle Maison, but finish exploring the island before stepping inside. The final two type specialists—the
Ground-type
master, Poké Maniac Kelvin, and the
Bug-type
master, Bug Maniac Felix—can be found staring each other down in a small arena to the west.
Visit the East Cabins
Go down the stairway to the east to reach a lower level with a couple of cabins. The woman in the first cabin turns out to be a Berry enthusiast; speak to her once per day to receive either a
Pomeg
,
Kelpsy
,
Qualot
,
Hondew
,
Grepa
, or
Tamato Berry
.
When you enter the eastern cabin, your eyes find a startling sight. It seems that a Team Magma Grunt and a Team Aqua Grunt have booked their own private cabin! You've startled them, and it's not long before other members of Team Magma and Team Aqua arrive. After the initial shock, it turns out that times have changed and nobody is upset about the two Grunts getting together.
Leave the Grunts' cabin to let them recover from their shocking discovery, and take the opportunity to rest at the Pokémon Center. Be sure to free up two slots in your party, as well. Return to their cabin afterward to learn that they've decided to call off their relationship after all. Relieved to have everything out in the open, and eager to put their unhappy past behind them, they each give you a Pokémon:
Camerupt
and
Sharpedo
!
Stilt Houses
Head east from the Grunts' cabin and cross the bridge to reach several stilt homes standing above the water. In the first house, a Collector will give you a
Footprint Ribbon
if you show him a Pokémon that you've raised 30 levels or more. Speak to the nearby Battle Girl afterward to receive a
Level Release
for your Secret Base. Check in on Looker next, who is resting comfortably with the Beauty in the neighboring house. He'll give you an
Audinite
as thanks for looking out for him on the beach.
Upper level
The Famous Whismur Show
Return to the Grunts' cabin and climb the nearby stairway to reach the island's highest point. An impressive model of the proposed Battle Frontier is prominently displayed here, and to the west lies the Battle Resort's happiest attraction—the Whismur show! Watch the Whismur dance each day, and try to pick out the one that's holding the
Big Mushroom
. If you guess correctly, you get to keep the item, which can be sold to stores for
$
2500.
Battle Maison
Having given the entire island a thorough search, it's now time to check out the
Battle Maison
! There's plenty of battling to be done inside, but don't worry about resting up beforehand. The receptionist in the main hall will heal your Pokémon before each battle, and you will also find a handy PC if you should need to reorganize the Pokémon in your party or Battle Box.
Challengers fight to earn
Battle Points
and to increase their current winning streak. Battles conducted here are subject to
certain rules
that differ from normal battles. The amount of
awarded Battles Points
varies based on the length of the current winning streak. These points may be redeemed for
valuable prizes
.
Certain Pokémon
are ineligible to participate. After reaching both 20 and 50 consecutive victories in each format—
Single
,
Double
,
Triple
, and
Rotation
—challengers must face one of the
Battle Chatelaines
. Defeating one of these four sisters on the 50th consecutive victory earns the challenger a commemorative monument located in the building's lobby.
Pokémon League: Round 2
Now that the events of the Delta Episode is over, the Champion
Steven Stone
is back at the Pokémon League, enabling for you to be able to challenge them again when you return to
Ever Grande City
. This time around some of the Pokémon on the Elite Four and Champion's teams have been replaced by Non-regional Pokémon and Steven has brought back some
Key Stones
, allowing one of the Pokémon on each of the Elite Four's team to be able to
Mega Evolve
. Aside from the new Pokémon and new Mega Evolutions everything else is still the same as last time in terms of strategy. Due to the levels for the teams of the Elite Four and Champion being higher than last time, make sure your team is around Level 70.

Sidney now has
Scrafty
,
Mandibuzz
, and
Zoroark
in place of
Mightyena
and
Cacturne
. For Scrafty, it uses it's natural moves
Crunch
, or
Brick Break
, and also uses
Poison Jab
to counter
Fairy-types
. Unless if you have a fast Fairy-type, then just use a
Flying-type
, or another Fighting-type to beat it. Mandibuzz uses the strongest physical Flying-type move
Brave Bird
, as well as
Tailwind
which will allow for it to attack first while in effect, and also uses
Bone Rush
to cover its weakness to
Electric
or
Rock-types
. If you do not want risk using the two aforementioned types, then counter with Fairy or
Ice-types
. Lastly Zoroark specializes in speed and offensive, though it has a very weak defense. Its
Dark Pulse
may cause your Pokémon to flinch and its
Night Slash
may cause a critical hit, which can make it deadly. Fortunately aside from the fact it can counter
Bug-types
with
Flamethrower
it can still be easily taken down with Fighting or Fairy-types.

In place of
Dusclops
and one of her
Banette
, Phoebe now has a
Mismagius
,
Drifblim
, and
Chandelure
. For Mismagius it can use
Pain Split
to even out the HP between you and it, so take it out as quickly as possible. Any
Dark-type
excluding the duel-types that are weak to
Thunderbolt
or
Power Gem
should work, especially if they are fast enough. Drifblim can use
Phantom Force
, a two turn Ghost-type move that is really powerful and cannot be defended against with
Protect
or
Detect
and
Acrobatics
, a powerful Flying-type move that is at full capacity since Drifblim is not holding an item. Its other moves should pose no problem if you use a Dark, Ghost, or Electic-type to defeat it as long as it doesn't have a type weak against
Icy Wind
or
Psychic
, but remember your Pokémon will take damage from
Aftermath
if you finish Drifblim off with a move that causes physical contact. For Chandelure the power of its
Hex
move can be increase if your Pokémon suffers a
Burn
either from Flamethrower, or its ability
Flame Body
if you use a move that causes physical contact. It also can use
Energy Ball
to counter
Water-types
. Unless if you have a faster Water-type, exploit its other weaknesses and bring in some healing items, if you need to risk the chance of getting inflicted with Flame Body.

Glacia now has only one
Glalie
and
Froslass
, and has added
Abomasnow
,
Beartic
, and
Vanilluxe
to her team. For Abomasnow it's ability
Snow Warning
creates
Hail
, enabling
Blizzard
to always hit and
Wood Hammer
can dish out tons of damage due to its high attack. While it may have
Earthquake
to counter
Fire
and
Steel-types
, a quicker Fire-type can beat it due to both its slow speed, and that it take 4× damage from Fire-type attacks. For Beartic, its best attack is
Icicle Crash
that can cause a lot of damage and may make the Pokémon flinch and it has Brick Break to counter Rock and Steel-types. A Fire or Fighting-type should be able to easily beat it. Vanilluxe has
Mirror Coat
where it survives a special attack, it can send the damage back at double the force. Another threat it possesses is
Freeze-Dry
, which is bad for Water-types as it reverse the type of the damage they take, to which the normally "not very effective" damage they take from Ice-type moves becomes "super-effective damage". Using any type that is effective against the Ice-type should work here, preferably with physical moves.

move, and can counter
Ground-types
with
Hydro Pump
and Fairy-types with
Sludge Wave
. Use Ice or Psychic-types to beat it. Haxorus uses
Dragon Claw
as its Dragon-type move, and has other hard-hitting physical moves, Shadow Claw, Earthquake, and
X-Scissor
. It should be possible to beat it with Fairy, Ice, or other Dragon-types.

, which due to its high speed can pose a problem as it has a chance of causing your Pokémon to flinch and also uses all three elemental fang attacks
Thunder Fang
,
Ice Fang
, and
Fire Fang
that helps cover its weaknesses. Only the Electric type can easily handle Aerodactyl as long as the Pokémon does not have another type weak against these three moves. Carbink has
Moonblast
and
Power Gem
to powerful special moves that matches its type, and can also use
Earth Power
to counter Steel-types which cause it 4× damage. While it might not be strong in offense, its defense stats can be annoying to deal with. If you do not want to risk it with Steel-types, use, Ground, Water, or
Grass-types
instead.
Once you defeat Steven again, you will receive the
Metagrossite
from him, allowing you to Mega Evolve your own
Metagross
. Sit by and watch the credits roll again.
Littleroot Town
Once you resume your game, leave your house. Once you are outside, you'll hear
Professor Birch
's screams. Once again he is in trouble at
Route 101
.
Route 101
Professor Birch is being chased around once again and for the fourth time, you'll look into his bag where you can find a set of first partner Pokémon which you can pick one of them to have. This time it is one of the first partners from the
Sinnoh
region.
