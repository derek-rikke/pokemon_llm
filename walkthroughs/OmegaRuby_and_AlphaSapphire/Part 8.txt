Meet Lanette
Inside the Pokémon Center, you find the PC in use by a woman named
Lanette
. She upgraded the previous version of the
Pokémon Storage System
, adding a user-friendly graphical interface, the ability to store nearly 1,000 Pokémon, and the ability to change the
wallpaper
of each Box. As she leaves, she invites you to visit her home on
Route 114
.
Abduction!
As you continue westward, May/Brendan calls out to you. Your friend leads you to
Professor Cozmo
's house, where you learn that the professor has been abducted by
Team Magma
OR
/
Team Aqua
AS
. It seems that the group has plans for the Meteorite that Cozmo has been researching, and has taken it and the professor to
Meteor Falls
! She/He asks that you meet up there, then rushes off.
Move Maniac
The
Move Maniac
lives in the northwest house. This helpful guy knows every move a Pokémon can learn as it grows and can teach forgotten moves to any Pokémon, for a price. He charges a single
Heart Scale
for each move relearned. These rare items can sometimes be found by clearing
cracked rocks
.
Route 114
Route 114
Pockmarked by fallen Meteorites, the lengthy
Route 114
leads up the mountainside to
Meteor Falls
. The
Fossil Maniac
lives up north, while
Lanette
's home stands on the water's edge.

Fossil Maniac
The
Fossil Maniac
's house stands on the outskirts of
Fallarbor Town
. Head inside and talk to his little brother, who kindly gives you
TM28
(
Dig
). When used in the field, Dig can be used while in a cave to return to the entrance. If you visit the cave at the back of the house, you will find the Fossil Maniac hard at work. He won't give up any Fossils, but hints that others may be uncovered by
Route 111
's raging sandstorm.
Lanette's House
Go south across the bridge to reach
Lanette
's house. Inside, you find the woman struggling to organize her clutter. She is happy that you stopped by, but embarrassed by the state of her home. If you promise to keep her messiness a secret, she will give you a
Seedot Doll
OR
/
Lotad Doll
AS
in return.
After receiving the Decoration, talk to her again and she asks if you would like to organize the Pokémon stored in the PC more efficiently. Say yes, and she will update the PC so that the handy
Organize Boxes
option is moved to the top of the screen. This change can be undone by speaking to her again.
A Berry A Day
Speak to the Rich Boy outside Lanette's house and he will give out one random Berry every day. Visit him every day to receive either a
Razz Berry
,
Bluk Berry
,
Nanab Berry
,
Wepear Berry
, or
Pinap Berry
.
Race to the Falls!
As you begin the climb up the mountainside, you spot May/Brendan a short distance ahead. She/He seems to witness
Team Magma
OR
/
Team Aqua
AS
on the move with
Professor Cozmo
in tow, and rushes off in pursuit. Pick up the pace to help your friend save the professor!

Nestled in the mountains between Routes

Meteor Falls
is said to have been the site of a meteor shower in the distant past, at a time when
an ancient people
still made their home here. The cavern's rushing rapids prevent novice Trainers from fully exploring the area, as doing so requires certain
field
moves
.

Despite having been defeated, Team Magma
OR
/Team Aqua
AS
simply shrugs off the loss. Suddenly, you hear a voice mocking the professor's kidnappers. It's
Archie
OR
/
Maxie
AS
, leader of the opposing Team Aqua
OR
/Team Magma
AS
! Realizing that the odds are against them,
Tabitha
OR
/
Shelly
AS
orders the Grunt to steal
Professor Cozmo
's Meteorite, and the two make their escape to
Mt. Chimney
. Archie
OR
/Maxie
AS
introduces himself and informs you of his team's mission. It makes no difference to him if you keep meddling in the other team's plans, but he warns you not to get in his way. He and his two Grunts then set off for Mt. Chimney as well. Afterwards, May/Brendan helps you get the professor back to his lab in
Fallarbor
.
Also, remember to come back later after completing the final gym to explore the upper floors of Meteor Falls. There you will find new Pokémon such as a
Bagon
, as well as a useful TM,
TM02
(
Dragon Claw
).
Fallarbor Town
Professor Cozmo's Lab
Route 115
Even though the Meteorite has been lost, the professor has still been saved. Cozmo hands both you and May/Brendan a copy of
TM23
(
Smack Down
) as a token of his gratitude.
The Meteorite must be recovered, but your friend is eager to continue to the next Gym. She/He offers to accompany you back to
Mauville City
. Accept the offer, and you will be whisked away to the big city; decline, and you'll have a chance to continue exploring
Meteor Falls
and
Route 115
on a roundabout route back to Mauville.
Route 115
Meteor Falls
' western exit opens to
Route 115
, a seaside locale that links back to
Rustboro City
. The harsh terrain hinders overland travel, making
Surf
a necessity to fully explore the area.

Though it was possible to visit Route 115 when you first reached
Rustboro City
, by traveling to the area through Meteor Falls, you can now explore the route more thoroughly than before. Fight a few Trainers as you comb the hills for a
Great Ball
and a few Berries. You can also use the
Dowsing Machine
to uncover a
Heart Scale
on the beach. But where are the Pokémon? With no tall grass on the route's south side, the only species to be found are those that can be hooked with the
Old Rod
. Return once you can
Surf
outside of battle to reach the north side, where more Pokémon and items await!
