Treasure Hunter's House

The hideout belonging to
Team Magma
OR
/
Team Aqua
AS
can be found in a cave to the northeast of
Lilycove
's beach. You'll need to storm their hideout in order to retrieve
Captain Stern
's submarine, so bring a party that can handle plenty of battles against them. When choosing your team, remember that Team Magma often uses
Fire
- and
Dark-type
Pokémon, while Team Aqua often uses
Water
- and Dark-type Pokémon.

Climb the stairway and take the warp panel to the east. This leads you to a small enclosed room; collect the
Nugget
before warping back. Continue west then north to reach another warp panel; this one takes you to 1F's northwest room. Go east, defeat the two Grunts, then take the warp panel to the southeast room; take a rest in one of the beds and grab the
Full Restore
before warping back. Next, take the stairs down to B1F.
B1F
A
vending machine
just south of the stairs offers drinks for
$
50 less than usual. Pick up the nearby
Escape Rope
then head east. Battle another Grunt to reach a small lab with a meteorite; it seems Team Magma had tried to create their own
Red Orb
by irradiating the rock with lasers. There are two warp panels in this room. Take the northwest panel to a library room and collect the
Max Elixir
before warping back. The northeast panel leads to another panel that leads to
Courtney
's room; collect
TM97
(
Dark Pulse
) and warp back. In the meteorite room, take the warp panel in the hallway to the southeast. Go west to reach another small lab, where sturdy protective gear called the
Magma Suit
is on display. Grab the
Nest Ball
in the northeast corner, then take the southeast warp. This leads to another warp that leads to the dock in the submarine room; pick up the
PP Max
before warping back. In the Magma Suit lab, take the southwest warp to another warp that leads to
Tabitha
's room. Warp back, exit the room, fight another Grunt, then go north to another warp panel. This takes you to the middle of B1F, and two more warp panels. Take the southern warp to the warp hallway.
Warp accesses
The warp hallway is a maze made of a dozen warp panels. To advance, start with the right-most panel, then the middle one, then the right-most one. This takes you to the southern-most row; take the southeast warp here to reach
Maxie
's room.
In Maxie's room, you'll find four items in the northwest corner. Two of them are actually
Electrode
in disguise, while the bottom-right item is a
Nugget
and the top-left item is a
Master Ball
! This type of Poké Ball will catch any wild Pokémon without fail, and is best used on hard-to-catch legendary Pokémon.
Back in the warp panel room, start on the middle panel in the south row, then go left to reach the north end of the room. Take the northern-most warp back to the middle of B1F.
B1F
Fight off the Grunt here and step on the warp panel to the west. This leads to the south side of the submarine room.
In the submarine room, Team Magma has nearly finished their modifications to
Captain Stern
's submarine. Defeat the nearest Grunt, then fight off a group of five Grunts at once in a
Horde Battle
. Grab the
Max Revive
tucked away in the southwest corner, then go north to confront
Courtney
. She's the only thing standing between you and stopping
Maxie
's getaway!

The battle lasted just long enough for Maxie to escape in his souped-up submarine. You've got to chase after him to the
Seafloor Cavern
, but you have no means of diving underwater like he can in his sub. For now, you'll have to keep to the surface. Head north then east and take the warp panel there back to the cave entrance and
Lilycove City
. The Grunt and his
Wailmer
blockade have disappeared from the beach, leaving you free to venture out into the eastern ocean.

Route 124
holds all sorts of treasure, but most lie on the ocean floor far below. It's not possible to fully explore the area without
a certain field move
, so for now the route simply serves as a connector between

Route 126
to the south, and
Mossdeep City
to the east.
