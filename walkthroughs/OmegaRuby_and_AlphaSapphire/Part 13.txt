A Berry A Day
Slateport City
When you arrive in
Slateport
, head straight for the northeast part of town. Outside Slateport Harbor, you find
Captain Stern
wrapping up a TV interview in front of a small crowd. Afterwards, you catch up with him for a little chat where he informs you of his newest discovery. He's found an underwater cavern on
Route 128
, and believes it to be the den of a super-ancient Pokémon long though to have been extinct. Just then, you hear a voice booming out from a megaphone. It's
Maxie
OR
/
Archie
AS
, who mocks the captain and thanks him for the
submarine
.
Slateport Harbor
After rushing inside the building, you find
Maxie
OR
/
Archie
AS
standing near the sub, ready to depart. He accepts that you won't simply leave him to his plans, and urges you to visit their hideout in
Lilycove City
. But he's come too far to be stopped now, and his faithful Admin,
Tabitha
OR
/
Shelly
AS
, orders a pair of Grunts to keep you busy while the other two escape in the sub.

Once the battle ends, your friend heads back to

to continue working on her/his Pokédex.
Move Deleter's House
Climb the stairway and visit the first house to the east. This is the home of the
Move Deleter
, an absent-minded man with the power to make your Pokémon forget any move. This is the only way for a Pokémon to forget an
HM

Move Reminder
in
Fallarbor Town
, the Move Deleter's services are free of charge.

is held here. A special selection of Secret Base Decorations are offered, with items listed anywhere from
$
200 to
$
6,000.
Lilycove Museum
The
Lilycove Museum
stands in the northwest part of town. The museum's curator blocks the stairs to the second floor because he hasn't yet decided what sort of exhibit to display upstairs. Once you start winning Master Rank Contests, your Pokémon's portraits will begin appearing on the second floor of the Contest Halls. An artist from the museum will become enamored with these portraits and ask to put them on display here. If you agree, up to 15 of your most recent Pokémon portraits will be displayed: three from each of the five contest conditions. More art fans will visit the museum as you fill its walls with portraits. The curator will be so thankful for the crowds that he will give you a reward after supplying all 15 portraits: a
Glass Ornament
for your Super-Secret Base.
Near the entrance is a Kindler who offers to sell you one of his modern art pieces. These eye-catching "masterpieces" can be used as Decorations in your base.
