Route 133
Route 134
The waters of Routes
132
,
133
, and
134
hold strong ocean currents that make travel difficult. While moving primarily westbound, these currents can send you sailing in almost any direction. This makes it necessary to revisit the area in order to explore every island.

From Route 132's route sign, Surf northwest to Swimmer ♂ Gilbert. Sail west from him to reach a

near Fisherman Ronald on the northwest island. From here, take the northern-most current to the northern shallows of Route 133. Once there, Surf westward to reach the north side of the route's northwest island. Collect the
Star Piece
here, and talk to the Psychic to receive

and two hidden
Heart Scales
. Surf west to reach the shallows with Dragon Tamer Aaron.
Central path
Fly or Soar back to Route 132. Enter the currents on the south side of the rocky island, then go north to reach a small island with a
Protein
. Stand on the isle's northern edge and sail west to reach the northwest island with Fisherman Ronald. Sail southward to ride the current to the southern of two shallows on Route 133, and collect the
Big Pearl
there. Surf westward to reach the south side of Route 133's northwest island, and battle Swimmer ♀ Sheryl. Sail west again to battle Bird Keeper Alex in the shallows of Route 134's largest island.
Southern path
Fly or Soar back to Route 132. Enter the currents on the south side of the rocky island. Go south to fight Black Belt Kiyo on the crescent-shaped island, then sail from the isle's western-most point to reach an islet with
TM34
(
Sludge Wave
) between two sandbars. Surf west to an island with Route 133's route sign and a
Max Revive
. Sail north through the ring of rocks to reach the route's central island, and battle Fisherman River and collect the
Calcium
. Surf west from here to arrive on Route 134's route-sign island, and move to its northwest corner. From here, sail west to an islet with a hidden
Heart Scale
. Go west again to the southwest shallows to fight Ace Trainer Elaine and pick up a
Star Piece
.
One Last Treasure
Fly or Soar back to Route 133 this time. Leave from the island's western or southern side to reach the nearest island with Bird Keeper Beck, Ace Trainer Warren, and Backpacker Grayson. Surf westward to reach some abandoned shallows that extend into Route 134. Sail west from the northwest corner to skirt around a deep pit of water, and arrive in a calm patch of ocean. Circle around the rocks to reach an islet with
TM80
(
Rock Slide
).
To the Depths
After exploring the rest of the area, Fly or Soar back to
Route 133
. Pass through the western or southern gap in the ring of rocks to return to the shallows with three Trainers. Surf west to reach the abandoned shallows once more. Jump into the currents from the middle part of the west side to reach the deep, dark pit of water.
Dive
beneath the waves and follow the underwater path southward to a sunlit spot. The markings on the nearby wall are an ancient form of writing, and translate to
Go up here
.
Surface in the sunlit spot to emerge in an ancient ruin known as the
Sealed Chamber
.
Sealed Chamber, Entrance

Sealed Chamber, Back Room
R
S
Sealed Chamber
The
Sealed Chamber
is a mysterious ruin located in the depths of
Route 134
. The many stone tablets positioned around the chamber feature the same mysterious writing that was found near the underwater entrance. Solving some of
Hoenn
's oldest mysteries hinges on deciphering this age-old system.
Entrance
The first chamber holds ten stone tablets that act as a key to decoding this ancient writing system, known as
Braille
. These 28 characters correspond to the 26 letters of the alphabet, as well as the comma and period. Inspect the markings on the cavern's north wall to reveal a phrase, which translates to
Dig here
. Using
the field move
causes the wall to fall away, granting you access to a second cavern.
Back Room
The central ruins are encircled by
six more stone tablets
which tell of a powerful Pokémon that was sealed away. The message on the north wall reads,
First comes
Relicanth
. Last comes
Wailord
.
Wailord's pre-evolved form,
Wailmer
, can be found in many areas with the
Good Rod
or
Super Rod
, while Relicanth can be found only in a few underwater areas. Position these Pokémon in their respective places in your party and examine the wall again. This causes a mighty earthquake to rock the Sealed Chamber, while the sound of doors opening echoes from somewhere far away. Three separate ruins have now been opened, and each one holds a legendary Pokémon!

Meeting Regigigas
Start off by visiting
Pacifidlog Town
again, and speak to the girl in the northeast house. Now that you've caught the trio, the girl tells you one of four stories she heard from her grandfather, which serve as hints about an elusive legendary Pokémon.
"Grandpa used to say that this huge Pokémon sometimes visits our region..."
"But he said you'll need to wait in the middle when it's bright and Hoenn is overflowing with natural energy. I wonder if he meant you can't meet it at night."
"But you'll need to have three of its friends with you to meet it... I wonder what Pokémon they are. Does it have to do with the six dots?"
"But you'll need to have something cold to meet it... I wonder what he meant. Ice cream, maybe?"
"He told me that it comes to visit this iceberg kind of Pokémon. I can only think of one kind of iceberg Pokémon."
In order to meet the Regigigas, certain conditions must be met.
The Hoenn region must be enriched by the energy released by the super-ancient Pokémon's
Primal Reversion
in the
Cave of Origin
.
All three
legendary giants
must all be included in your party.
Regice must be given a nickname. To do this, visit the
Name Rater
in
Slateport City
.
Regice must also be given a cold item to hold. This may be a
Never-Melt Ice
, a
Casteliacone
, an
Icy Rock
, an
Icicle Plate
, or a
Snowball
.
It may be necessary to let a day pass first, if all three giants were caught in a row. Wait until the sun rises again before setting out.
Route 105
Island Cave
After meeting all requirements, return to
Route 105
and revisit the
Island Cave
. Enter the back cavern during the day and move to the center of the room. An earthquake suddenly rocks the island, and the sound of something large approaching can be heard. If you fail to catch it,
Regigigas
will reappear once you enter the
Hall of Fame
.
