Pokémon Day Care
The
Pokémon Day Care
is a facility that raises Pokémon for busy Trainers. For a small fee, up to two Pokémon can be left here to be raised by the Day Care staff. During their stay, Pokémon will gradually level up and learn new moves. When two
compatible
Pokémon are left at the same time, you may return to find an
Egg
! Speak to the Day-Care Man and he will hint at the odds of finding one.

"Those two seem peaceable enough toward each other."

Whenever an Egg is found, the Day-Care Man will be facing the road, eager to talk to you. Speak to him to receive the Egg, and carry it with you on your journey. The more you travel with an Egg, the faster the Pokémon inside will hatch.
Verdanturf Town
Verdanturf Town
Verdanturf
is a small town just west of
Route 117
, at the foot of the mountains. Due to the prevailing wind pattern, the area is always kept clear of falling volcanic ash.
Wally
is visiting with his uncle's family here, in the hopes that the fresh, clean air will improve his health.

Rusturf Tunnel
. She often goes there to visit him.
Lost and Found
The little girl near Wanda's House is sad about losing her
Shroomish
. She believes that the Pokémon got separated from her near the town sign. Inspect the sign, and Shroomish pops out from behind it. The Pokémon is automatically reunited with the little girl, who is so relieved that she rewards you with an
Intriguing Stone
!

Reunion
With the
Dynamo Badge
, you can finally use
Rock Smash
to clear a path through
Rusturf Tunnel
. Step inside and go northwest to reach a group of cracked rocks. Clear the debris to open the tunnel and reunite
Wanda
with her hardworking boyfriend. As thanks, he gives you an
Aggronite
that he found in the cave!
Lost His Glasses
Take the tunnel's middle exit to reach a previously-unreachable part of
Route 116
. The Bug Maniac here has lost his glasses, so dig out your
Dowsing Machine
and use it to track down a pair of
Black Glasses
. These aren't the glasses he lost though, so you get to keep them. Before moving on, be sure to grab the
HP Up
on the ridge.
The Researcher's Reward
Continue through Rusturf Tunnel to its western exit to return to Route 116. A
Devon
researcher can be found just outside the tunnel. It's the same researcher that you've helped before, and as thanks for delivering the
Devon Parts
to
Captain Stern
, he wishes to reward you with a
Repeat Ball
. After receiving this one, you can buy Repeat Balls,
Net Balls
, and
Timer Balls
in Rustboro City.
Rustboro City
Devon Corporation
Stop by
Rustboro City
to visit
Mr. Stone
. He should be happy to see you after all the favors you've done for him. This time he does you a favor, by identifying the
Intriguing Stone
you obtained in
Verdanturf
. It turns out to be a Mega Stone, a
Pidgeotite
.
