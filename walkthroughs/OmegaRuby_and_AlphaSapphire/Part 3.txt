Dewford Hall
Located to the north of the Pokémon Center, Dewford Hall is known as "Everyone's Information Exchange". Though Dewford is a tiny island community, when someone coins a
trendy phrase
here, it quickly spreads throughout the region. Speak to the boy outside the building to learn that "Potion festivals" are the coolest thing in cool right now; if you disagree, he offers a chance to change the current phrase, which the residents inside will quickly adopt.
Hook the Big One!
Speak to the Fisherman outside the Gym, and answer his question to receive the
Old Rod
. This low-end fishing rod can hook Pokémon from any body of water, so be sure to try it out everywhere!
Dewford Gym
Dewford Gym
Dewford Town Pokémon Gym
Leader: Brawly
A big wave in fighting!
The
Dewford Gym
specializes in
Fighting-type
Pokémon.
Flying
-,
Psychic
, and
Fairy-type
moves are the most effective here, so this is a great opportunity to train
Taillow
,
Beautifly
,
Wingull
, or
Ralts
.
Zubat
is also good once it reaches level 13, and it being part of your team when attacking Brawly will boost its friendship, which you need to raise for it to evolve into
Crobat
eventually. Keep your
Normal
-,
Rock
-, and
Dark-type
Pokémon out of the fray for now. The Gym is modeled as a fitness center, filled with weight-lifting equipment and exercise machines. The buff Trainers inside hone their skills by training in total darkness. Step on the floor switches in the main hall to temporarily light up the darkened rooms, then plot a path forward before stepping into the darkness.
Even with only two Pokémon,
Brawly
can be a tough opponent. Both his
Machop
and
Makuhita
have the
Guts
Ability, which boosts the Pokémon's
Attack
by 50% when afflicted by any status condition.
Bulk Up
allows the user to raise its Attack and
Defense
, and Machop can deal even more damage by lowering the target's Defense with
Leer
.

After the battle, Brawly awards you the
Knuckle Badge
, which ensures obedience of all Pokémon up to level 30. He also hands out
TM08
(
Bulk Up
) as a prize.
If you speak to Brawly again, he suggests checking out
Granite Cave
to the north of town. The place is filled with rare stones and wall paintings thousands of years old, and his friend
Steven
rushed there as soon as Brawly told him about it.

Follow the tunnel to the northwest to find a Hiker, who gives out
TM70
(
Flash
). Turn north and follow the sloping path down to the first floor's rear chamber.
1F (Back)
In the rear chamber, you find
Steven
admiring an ancient wall painting. Give him the
Letter
from
Mr. Stone
to complete your mission, and Steven gives you
the TM
for his favorite move,
Steel Wing
, in return.
The Mural
This ancient artwork was only recently discovered, and attracts visitors from far and wide.
A huge Pokémon is depicted in a terrible rage, with what appear to be omegas (Ω) marked on either arm. Volcanoes erupt all around this behemoth, while humans and Pokémon are overwhelmed by its power. In addition, there seems to be a meteor in the shape of a triangle falling from the sky, while the rest of the heavens are dominated by a monstrous, broiling sun.
A gigantic Pokémon is shown wreaking havoc, with what appear to be alphas (α) marked on its arms. The sea swells around this leviathan in enormous waves and a great storm rages overhead, with heavy rain and lightning bolts. A falling star in the shape of a triangle appears over the figures of defeated people and Pokémon, a dark herald of their suffering.
Dewford Town
Talk to
Mr. Briney
on the pier and inform him of your successful delivery. He tells you that
Mr. Stone
has already assigned you a new task: delivering the
Devon Parts
to someone named
Stern
in
Slateport City
.
