Meet the Secret Base Expert
A stranger catches your eye as proceed northward. He introduces himself as
Aarune
,
Unova
-born and spent the last 11 years trying to find himself. "A vagabond in search of dreams", he's been wandering
Hoenn
on a quest to find the perfect
Super-Secret Base
. He gives you
TM43
(
Secret Power
), which can be used to establish a Super-Secret Base when examining a
Secret Spot
, any of the suspicious-looking trees, wall markings, and clumps of grass scattered across the region. The former Pokémon Ranger uses the field move to open the Secret Spot in the nearby tree; inside, he explains the basics of decorating a base. He then asks what you say when you're happy; your response will be shown to other Trainers visiting your base. He decides to leave this location for you, rather than take it for himself. He sets up a small PC and five tile markers, and even gives you a few
Decorations
to get you started. Finally, he suggests visiting other people's bases to collect the flag next to each one's PC. As he leaves, he tells you that he'll be at the Secret Base Guild in
Fortree City
.

To Fallarbor!
As you enter the route, you catch up with May/Brendan. The Trainer is headed to
Fallarbor
to meet
Professor Cozmo
, but the long road forced your friend to stop for a rest. After restoring your Pokémon's health, she/he informs you that Cozmo is famous for his studies on Meteorites. It seems that he and
Professor Birch
are investigating how these Meteorites may affect Pokémon.
Glass Workshop
The
Glass Workshop
stands near the route's west end. Step inside and talk to the owner to receive a free
Soot Sack
, which can be used to collect ash by running through the dark piles scattered along the route. The constantly-falling ash replenishes these piles whenever you return to the area.
When dashing through a soot pile, one of four things may happen:
3-4 grams of ash is collected. In certain locations, an item is found as well.
A small (5-15 grams) random amount is collected.
A large (20-100 grams) random amount is collected.
In certain locations, a Trainer may appear and challenge you, and no ash is collected.
Speak with the workshop owner to learn how much ash you've collected. By providing him with the correct amounts, he is able to create valuable glass items.
