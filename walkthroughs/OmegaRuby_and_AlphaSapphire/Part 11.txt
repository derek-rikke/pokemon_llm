Route 119
Known for its sweltering heat and sudden rainfalls, the spacious
Route 119
runs north from
Route 118
to
Fortree City
. The area is filled with patches of tall grass, which hide Trainer and wild Pokémon alike. The extreme weather conditions make this an ideal setting for the
Weather Institute
, located on the north end of this tropical rainforest.

The Mimic Circle
A handful of Trainers in the southernmost patch of long grass like to copy the movements of any Trainer passing by, collectively earning them the "Mimic Circle" nickname. They move when you do, so outmaneuver them to pin them down and start battling. Each one remains in a certain area, which gives you a chance to corner them.
Rest Stop
A small cabin stands beyond the patch of long grass. Speak to the kind woman inside, and she'll let you and your Pokémon take a quick break to restore their health.
Weather Institute
Located on the north end of the route, the
Weather Institute
is a high-tech facility used to study and research the intricacies of weather patterns across

Looking for Answers
When you reach the second floor, you find the source of the disturbance: Magma Admin
Tabitha
OR
/Aqua Admin
Shelly
AS
is harassing the researchers! Having doubts about his/her leader's plans, the Admin is here to have some questions answered. After looking through some research papers about extreme weather conditions from thousands of years ago, Tabitha
OR
/Shelly
AS
learns that his/her leader's plan to awaken the super-ancient Pokémon will bring about the same dramatic conditions across the region, and seems pretty shaken up by this. Seeking a reprieve from his/her misgivings, he/she drags you into battle!

The Next Step
After his/her defeat, the Admin reveals a bit more about the team's plans, including that the Leader is headed for
Mt. Pyre
, before he/she and the Grunts leave the building. As thanks for your help, one of the researchers even rewards you with a new Pokémon,
Castform
, which changes its type and appearance based on the current weather.
The researchers then reveal that the cataclysmic weather conditions thousands of years ago were triggered by the two super-ancient Pokémon. When
Groudon
and
Kyogre
absorbed the abundant natural energy of the young planet, they were able to regain terrible, primal powers that they had lost, through a process known as
Primal Reversion
. It seems that Team Magma
OR
/Team Aqua
AS
plans to harness these powers to achieve their own destructive goals.
As you leave, speak to the Scientist in the lobby to receive a
Rocky Helmet
. Speak to the receptionist as well to get an
Icy Rock
as a souvenir. Visit her on three subsequent days to receive either a
Smooth Rock
,
Heat Rock
, or
Damp Rock
each day.
Rival Battle 3
Leave the building and cross the upper bridge.

Once you defeat her/him, your friend rewards you with
HM02
(
Fly
). It's a strong move in battle and even more useful when used in the field, though you'll need to win the Gym Badge from the next city first. She/He then runs off, leaving you to continue on to
Fortree City
.
Fortree City
Fortree City
Fortree City
is located in an old-growth forest with many towering trees. These ancient arbors are so large that the residents were able to build cozy homes among their branches. The
Fortree Gym
can be found in the heart of the city, and the
Secret Base Guild
stands in the southeast part of town.

, who gives you a
Proclamation
to use in your base and tells you all about secret teams. Using this Decoration lets you choose the type of battles that take place in your Secret Base. If you haven't yet formed a team, he recommends doing so by inviting some Secret Pals to your Secret Base. After that, your team will be ranked here based on the number of flags collected from other player's bases. Reaching higher ranks will unlock more
special skills
for your
Secret Pals
, and reaching Platinum Rank lets your Secret Pals use two skills per day. Higher ranks also earn you more rewards from Aarune.

Catch Sight of Steven
Descend the ladder near the Secret Base Guild, and go west then north to catch a glimpse of
Steven
. He heads off for
Route 120
to the east, apparently searching for a certain Pokémon.
Running Errands
Speak to the Pokémon Breeder in the northeast house to see his
Wingull
fly off on an errand. Return later to see if it's successful!
Reveal Your Hidden Power
The north-northwest house belongs to a pair of old women. Speak to the one on the left to take her quiz. She holds a coin in her hand, and asks in which one you think it's hidden. Guess correctly
three times in a row
to receive
TM10
(
Hidden Power
)! This unique attack is listed as a
Normal-type
move, but its type varies depending on the Pokémon using it. Talk to the old woman on the right to learn the type of Hidden Power your party members would have.
Time for a Trade
The little girl in the northwest house wants a
Spinda
. If you happened to catch one on
Route 113
, she'll give you her
Skitty
in return. Skitty arrives holding a
Magost Berry
.
Route 120
With an invisible object blocking the Gym, there's nothing else to do in the city. Go east to
Route 120
to catch up to Steven on the northern bridge. It seems that another unseen object blocks the way forward, but luckily Steven has a way to solve this mystery. He lets you try on the
Devon Scope
, a high-tech piece of eyewear that reveals invisible objects. Sure enough, they reveal a
Kecleon
in front of you; catch or defeat the Pokémon to clear the bridge. Pleased with your actions, Steven allows you to keep the device. He also hands you the Mega Stone that enables your starter Pokémon to Mega Evolve—
Sceptilite
,
Blazikenite
, or
Swampertite
. Now that your very first partner can Mega Evolve during battle, and with the Devon Scope in hand, you can chase off the Kecleon outside the Gym and win your next Badge!
Fortree City
Fortree Gym
Fortree City Pokémon Gym
Leader: Winona
The bird user taking flight into the world.
The
Fortree Gym
specializes in
Flying-type
Pokémon, which take serious damage from
Electric
,
Rock
, and
Ice
moves. The Gym is fairly straightforward, with ramps leading up to the Gym Leader's lofty perch. The only obstacles are turnstiles, some of which can only be spun in certain directions. Pass through the first two turnstiles to reach Bird Keeper Jared, and Picnicker Kylee beyond him. Approach the third turnstile from the west to spin it, then loop back around to take the newly cleared path. Go west, climb the ramp, and head north to reach the fourth turnstile and Camper Terrell. Battle Bird Keeper Will and proceed to the east wall. Go north through the fifth turnstile to reach Bird Keeper Bran, then head south through the sixth turnstile to return to the fifth. As it's already been moved once, you must return it to its original position by spinning it clockwise before you can pass through again. Pass by Bird Keeper Bran a second time and climb the ramp to reach the Gym Leader.
Winona
starts off with
Swellow
, which tends to lead with
Double Team
to raise its
evasiveness
. This can become increasingly problematic, so use super-effective moves to defeat it quickly. You can also use moves such as
Aerial Ace
,
Clear Smog
,
Disarming Voice
,
Feint Attack
,
Swift
,
Vital Throw
, or especially
Shock Wave
, which always hit. Her
Pelipper
takes massive damage from
Electric
attacks.
Rock
moves are also effective, but Rock Pokémon other than
Lileep
should be wary of its
Water Pulse
.
Skarmory
has several resistances and a high physical
Defense
, which may rise even higher due to
Steel Wing
.
Sand Attack
makes it harder to hit, while
Aerial Ace
's perfect
accuracy
lets it reliably land a hit. Use Fire or Electric moves to defeat Skarmory. Due to its
Dragon
typing, her
Altaria
takes only normal damage from Electric moves. Rock and Fairy moves will be more effective, and Ice moves are greater still. It can target unsuspecting Electric types with
Earthquake
and restore its health with
Roost
, which cancels its Flying type for one turn. While its
Special Defense
is higher,
Cotton Guard
gives it a staggering 150%
Defense
boost for every use, so Special moves are the better option.

Upon her defeat,
Winona
awards you the
Feather Badge
, which ensures obedience from all Pokémon up to level 70 and enables the use of
Fly
in the field. She also hands out
TM19
(
Roost
) as a prize.
Fly
allows you to instantly revisit any city or town you've previously explored. In addition, it can also be used to return to any route or other special location, like
Rusturf Tunnel
or
Mt. Chimney
! The only catch to Flying back to a route is that you must have reached the next city or town first. That means you can't Fly to Routes
120
or
121
until you've visited
Lilycove City
. While Fly can be used by selecting the appropriate party member, it can also be used by opening the
AreaNav
app and tapping the desired location.
