Slateport Market
The
open-air market
hosts numerous vendors peddling rare goods. A man near the southern entrance hints that you'll find even more bargains after obtaining
TM94
(
Secret Power
). Permanent stat-boosting
Vitamins
can be purchased from the Energy Guru. The red-clad clerk standing next to him will give your lead Pokémon an
Effort Ribbon
if it has been well-trained.
Incense
and
TMs
are also available from other vendors.
Pokémon Fan Club
The
Pokémon Fan Club
can be found just north of the Market. Speak to
Gabby
, the reporter, to tell her about your lead Pokémon. Give her and her cameraman a great interview and you may see yourself on the
BuzzNav
news! If your lead Pokémon is
friendly
enough toward you, you can receive a
Soothe Bell
from the woman near the back wall. Visit with the club's chairman to have him examine your lead Pokémon's condition. If any of its five Contest stats are high enough, he will reward you with a special item—a
Red
,
Blue
,
Pink
,
Green
, or
Yellow Scarf
. When held, these items boost their respective stat during the Appeal Round of a Contest Spectacular.
In addition, there is a Breeder here who offers to groom a certain Pokémon. For
$
500, she will
trim the coat
of a
Furfrou
, a Pokémon that is not native to the
Hoenn
region. Its coat will grow back in five days, or whenever it is deposited in the PC.
Name Rater
North of the Fan Club building is the home of the
Name Rater
. This man has the power to evaluate and change your Pokémon's nicknames as often as you'd like. However, he cannot change a Pokémon's nickname if it first belonged to someone else.
Slateport Harbor
The Harbor is located in the city's northeast district. Since construction is not yet complete on the new ferry, there is little to do here aside from stopping by the Vending Machine for
Soda Pop
.
Stern's Shipyard
Inside
Stern's Shipyard
, you find
the captain
's assistant,
Dock
, looking over plans for the
new ferry
that is under construction here. Stern is nowhere to be found, but Dock hints that he likes to visit the Oceanic Museum.
Oceanic Museum
At first, it is impossible to enter the
Oceanic Museum
because of the
Team Magma
OR
/
Team Aqua
AS
Grunts lined up outside. But by the time you visit the shipyard, the group has made its way into the building. Pay the
$
50 entrance fee to follow them inside. Those that can't afford it will be mistaken as part of "the group that came in earlier", and allowed in for free.
The Grunts are more interested in the exhibits than battling with you, so speak to them in an effort to gauge their intentions. Talk to the Grunt in the lower-right corner to give him a shock; it's the same guy you fought back in
Rusturf Tunnel
! He's learned not to mess with you, and begs forgiveness with
TM46
(
Thief
) before fleeing the scene.
Go upstairs to find
Captain Stern
, examining a display in the lower-right corner. Before you can hand over the
Devon Parts
for his new ferry, you are attacked by two Grunts! Defeat one after the other to save the captain and complete the delivery for
Mr. Stone
. Shocked at their failure, the two begin to plan their next move when a stranger appears. It's their boss,
Magma Leader
Maxie
OR
/
Aqua Leader
Archie
AS
! He seems impressed by the fire in your eyes. He explains his group's goal and departs, but not before warning against interfering with their future plans.
Something Spectacular
With the
Devon Parts
delivered, you're all done in
Slateport
. As you try to leave through the city's north exit, you are drawn to the excitement of a video shoot outside the
Contest Spectacular Hall
. A girl named
Lisia
is being filmed with her
Altaria
, Ali, and the frenzied crowd can't wait to see who she picks to debut in the Contest Spectaculars. It happens to be your lucky day, as she hands you a
Contest Pass
and a
Pokéblock Kit
, everything you need to get started in the "wild world of contesting"! Each new entrant starts off in a Normal Rank Contest; win, and the next, more prestigious rank is unlocked. Work your way up to a Master Rank Contest, and your win earns
a special Ribbon
your Pokémon can wear with pride. Collect all five with a single Pokémon to receive the rare Contest Star Ribbon!
When the shoot is over, follow Lisia inside. Approach the counter and she calls out to you. She is thrilled that you are ready to try a Contest, but has one more gift for you first. She leads you into the dressing room where she gives you a
Contest Costume
to wear during the show.
Once your first Contest is over, an inspired Breeder gives you a special female
Pikachu
. This
Cosplay Pikachu
loves dressing up for Contests, and starts out in either its Rock Star or Pop Star outfit. This Breeder loves to make costumes for it, and will set up in the dressing room to change its outfit whenever you like. Each of its five costumes is best suited for a certain Contest condition, and even lets Pikachu learn a new move that matches its costume.
Route 110
Route 110
The lengthy
Route 110
connects two of
Hoenn
's largest cities,
Slateport
and
Mauville
, and also links back to
Route 103
. All pedestrians are restricted to the lower path, which features the mysterious
Trick House
. After obtaining a Bike, you can use the
Seaside Cycling Road
to bypass the route.

Finding the Trick Master
When you step inside, you can't shake the feeling that someone is watching you. The mischievous Trick Master is hiding somewhere! Search the entire room until you find him, when he accepts your challenge and disappears. Certain field moves are required for most of the mazes, so you will need to return later to complete the rest.
Inside the Maze
Once he leaves, examine the scroll on the wall to find a secret passage that leads to a devious maze. Navigate the maze and battle Trainers as you search for a rolled-up scroll with a secret code. Reach the back of the maze and examine the hanging scroll. Inscribe the code on the hidden door to open it. There's no going back, so be sure to find everything the maze has to offer before entering the next room!
Trick Master's Room
The Trick Master waits here for all challengers. Speak to him to receive your reward, then leave through the exit in the north wall. After the last challenge, you should visit once more to say goodbye to one of his Mechadolls, and check his scroll too.
Rival Battle 2
Go east from the Trick House and pass beneath Cycling Road. Turn north and continue on until you meet
May
/
Brendan
again. It seems like ages since you last met, and your friend wants to see how far you've come as a Trainer!

May/Brendan is kind enough to heal your Pokémon after the battle. She/He then hands you the
Dowsing Machine
, a special gadget that allows you to search the surrounding area more thoroughly to discover hidden items! However, it can't detect an item if you are standing on it. When equipped, the machine emits different noises and the lights change color depending on how close you are to an item. When the lights turn red and the noises go wild, there's an item right in front of you! Search the underpass for treasure as you continue on to
Mauville City
.
Route 103 (East)
You can also explore the previously unreachable Eastern side of Route 103. Battling a few trainers can provide some extra experience points before reaching Mauville City.
