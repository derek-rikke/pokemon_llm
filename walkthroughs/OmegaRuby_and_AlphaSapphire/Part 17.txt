Secret Islet
Secret Islet
is a small island with a single tree on the southwest edge of
Route 126
. It can only be reached by Diving southwest of the main trench and surfacing on its sandy shore. The island is one of three locations that serious
Secret Base
enthusiasts seek out, as a base's layout tends to be better the farther away it is from civilization. There are no Trainers, wild Pokémon, or items here.
Sootopolis City
Sootopolis City
Sootopolis City
rises from the crater of a great meteoroid crash and can only be reached by sea or sky. The
final Gym
in the
Hoenn League
is located here, but there are more urgent matters to attend to first. With
Hoenn
's weather becoming increasingly oppressive, you must race to the
Cave of Origin
and stop the super-ancient Pokémon from achieving
Primal Reversion
and obtaining the vast power that's sure to come with it!

Rest Up
The recent shift in weather has frightened all of the city's residents, and they've all taken shelter inside their homes. Their doors are locked tight, so you can't visit with most of the locals right now. The
Sootopolis Gym
, on an island near the crater entrance, is also closed, so instead Surf eastward to reach the Pokémon Center and rest up for the trial ahead.
Catch Up with Steven
Surf westward past the Gym to a grassy shore. Climb the north stairway and continue north until you run into
Steven
talking with another man. The man introduces himself as
Wallace
, Sootopolis Gym Leader and protector of the
Cave of Origin
. Seeing your
Blue Orb
OR
/

AS
, he asks that you follow him. He leads you and Steven to the cave entrance, where you find
Maxie
,
Archie
, and
Tabitha
OR

OR

AS
gives you the

, a suit made by the villainous team to protect the wearer from the elements. Wallace assures the group that the Orb you hold will protect you and your Pokémon, and that together with the suit you just received, it will finally become possible to stand up to the forces of nature. Even
May
/
Brendan
shows up to wish you luck!
Cave of Origin
The
Cave of Origin
is said to hold a great source of ancient power. Whatever lies in its uncharted depths, it has drawn the attention of the super-ancient Pokémon. It must be stopped, and only you can save Hoenn from its destructive influence!

B4F
When you reach the edge of the lava

, you pull on the protective suit and attach the Blue Orb
OR

to it. The super-ancient Pokémon then appears with a cry, and you receive a radio message from Maxie
OR
/Archie
AS
instructing you to hop on its back and ride it to the cave's deepest level. The sound cuts out, but your course is clear. The suit you wear, combined with the power of the Orb you hold, protect you from harm as you ride the ancient creature along a river of lava
OR
/an underwater current
AS
to the cave's deepest chamber.
Final Chamber
In the final chamber, you pull off your protective suit as Groudon
OR
/Kyogre
AS
takes its place under a large stalactite. The super-ancient Pokémon begins drawing vast power from the mysterious crystal hanging above in order to undergo
Primal Reversion
, leaving you to watch in awe.
VS Groudon
OR
Primal Groudon using Precipice Blades
Primal Groudon's
Desolate Land
Ability summons extremely harsh sunlight for as long as it remains in battle. This strengthens all
Fire
moves and evaporates all
Water
moves. Unlike other weather-affecting tactics, Desolate Land can't be overridden by most other Abilities or moves. In addition to its new Ability, Primal Groudon also receives a new move—
Precipice Blades
, a
Ground-type
physical attack. Summoning vast power, Primal Groudon's
Attack
,
Defense
, and
Special Attack
have all increased, making it an incredibly formidable opponent. Its type has changed as well, from
Ground
to
Ground
/
Fire
; this combined with its Ability leaves it vulnerable only to Ground moves, unless you use a
Psyduck
or
Golduck
with the
Cloud Nine
ability. Bring it down before all of
Hoenn
goes up in flames!

Aftermath
With the super-ancient Pokémon's rampage put to an end, the remaining energy released within the Cave of Origin spills out as a beam of green light rising into the atmosphere. The skies quickly clear and the climate returns to normal as you emerge from the cave. Amazed by your success, Maxie
OR
/Archie
AS
can't help but wish that he'd never bothered the slumbering Pokémon. Seeing how well you handle the Blue Orb
OR
/Red Orb
AS
, he gives you the other to keep as well. If you managed to catch it, giving the super-ancient Pokémon the same-colored Orb to hold allows it to unleash its
Primal Reversion
during battle!
Team Magma
and
Team Aqua
depart, leaving you,
Steven
, and
May
/
Brendan
to catch up. Proud of all you've accomplished, Steven gives you a great gift: the
Eon Flute
. With this, you can summon
Latios
OR
/
Latias
AS
and
Soar
through Hoenn's skies. Steven suggests doing just that, as the region has now been enriched by the great energy released from the Cave of Origin. May/Brendan can't believe how far you've come, and is happy to have shared so many adventures with you.
Soaring in the Sky
With the Eon Flute, you and Latios
OR
/Latias
AS
can Soar the skies high above Hoenn.
Soar
is a variation of
Flying
that only these two Pokémon can use. In this way, you can visit all the same locations as with Fly, but that's not all. As you Soar freely over the region, you may stumble across new locations inaccessible by other means, and find more Pokémon you couldn't find before! As Soar
functions similarly to Fly
, you no longer need to keep a Pokémon that knows Fly in your party. It's even possible to Soar when the Eon Pokémon is in the PC. The top screen shows the action as you Soar the skies, while the Touch Screen shows a map of Hoenn with a yellow arrow marking your current location. As you pass over locations, their names will appear on-screen.
When Soaring, you may find
flocks of Flying Pokémon
; make contact to be drawn into battle! In addition, each day a new
Mirage spot
will appear somewhere in Hoenn. These locations always appear as sparkling red beacons. There, you may find valuable items and unusual Pokémon, even Legendary Pokémon when certain conditions are fulfilled.
Hoenn, Enriched
The great energy released by Groudon/Kyogre's Primal Reversion has blanketed the region, transforming the land into a rich, fertile habitat for Pokémon. This event marks the appearance of new Pokémon all over Hoenn. These Pokémon can be found hiding in the field, so use the DexNav's Detector Mode to find them. In addition, several new
Mega Stones
have appeared across the region.

Professor Birch
earlier that are sold at
$
1,500 each (sold as Withered Tree, Fading Fire, or Ebbing Tide).
Sootopolis Gym
Sootopolis City Pokémon Gym
Leader: Wallace
Artist, and lover of water
The
Sootopolis Gym
specializes in
Water-type
Pokémon.
Grass
- and
Electric-type
moves are best here, while
Fire
,
Ground
, and
Rock
Pokémon may struggle. The Gym features three platforms where each icy tile must be traversed once in order to reveal the next stairway. Walking over an ice tile once cracks it; passing by a second time shatters it, leaving you to fall to the Gym's watery underbelly where plenty of Trainers await.
The first puzzle is a 5×5 grid of ice. Starting on the south-central tile, move →2, ↑4, ←1, ↓3, ←1, ↑2, ←1, ↓3, ←1, ↑4, and →2. This reveals the first stairway.
The second puzzle is a 7×7 grid, with a 3×3 platform that can be freely traversed. From the south-central tile, move →3, ↑6, ←1, ↓5, ←3, ↓1, ←2, ↑1, →1, ↑1, ←1, ↑4, →2, ↓1, ←1, ↓2, →2 onto the platform, ↑2, →1, ↑1, and ←1. This reveals the second stairway.
The final puzzle is a 7×15 grid, with a trio of 3×3 platforms. Starting on the south-central tile, move ←7, ↑6, →6, ↓1, ←5, ↓4, →4, ↑3, →1 onto the middle platform, ↓3, →2, ↓1, →1, ↑4, ←2 onto the middle platform, ↑1, →6, ↓4, ←3, ↓1, →4, ↑6, and ←7. This reveals the stairway to the Gym Leader.
Wallace
leads with his
Luvdisc
; not much of a threat, but it may still confuse its target with
Sweet Kiss
, and further hinder male targets with
Attract
. As a
Water
/
Ground
Pokémon, his
Whiscash
is only vulnerable to Grass moves; its
Mud Sport
weakens Electric moves for a few turns, while
Earthquake
packs a punch.
Sealeo
's
Water
/
Ice
typing gives it additional weaknesses to
Fighting
and
Rock
moves;
Waterfall
and
Body Slam
deal damage while
Encore
forces the target to repeat its previous move. His
Seaking
is somewhat dangerous, if its target is Level 44 or less, when
Horn Drill
may score a
one-hit knockout
. Also,
Rain Dance
combined with
Waterfall
can deal a suprisingly lot of damage. Finally, his
Milotic
can deal heavy damage with
Hydro Pump
, and use
Ice Beam
to deal with Grass types other than the
Lotad
family; use powerful moves to defeat it quickly, before it can regain health with
Recover
.

Defeated, Wallace awards you the
Rain Badge
, which ensures obedience from all Pokémon. He also gives you
HM05
(
Waterfall
) as a prize. With all eight Badges, your next destination is the
Pokémon League
in
Ever Grande City
to the southeast. But first, consider exploring Hoenn's remaining areas, including
Route 129
and beyond. In addition, Wallace suggests visiting
Birch
back in
Littleroot
, as he's heard a rumor that the professor has created
a more powerful Pokédex
.
