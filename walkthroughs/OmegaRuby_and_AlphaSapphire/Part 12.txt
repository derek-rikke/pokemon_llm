After defeating

on
Route 118
, the news team can now be found in the northeast corner of the route. Accept their challenge and give them another great interview afterwards!
Scorched Slab
Scorched Slab
is a cave jutting up out of the north lake. It is said to be the hiding place of an elusive
Fire-type
Pokémon. While it's possible to explore the area now—and claim items like
TM11
(
Sunny Day
)—other treasures can't be obtained until later.
A Berry A Day
The route splits near its south end, with the western trail leading up to a plateau. Talk to the Aroma Lady near the stairway and she'll give you one rare Berry every day. The kind of Berry received depends on the last digit of your
Trainer ID number
.
Berry
Condition
Figy Berry
ID number ends in 0 or 5
Wiki Berry
ID number ends in 1 or 6
Mago Berry
ID number ends in 2 or 7
Aguav Berry
ID number ends in 3 or 8
Iapapa Berry
ID number ends in 4 or 9
Ancient Tomb
The unusual arrangement of stones on the southwest plateau is known as the
Ancient Tomb
. It is believed to mark the resting place of a legendary Pokémon. But with the entrance sealed, you won't be able to investigate until later.
Route 121
Route 121
Though smaller than the previous area,
Route 121
is more straightforward.
Route 122
runs off to the south, while
Lilycove City
lies to the east. The north side of the route is home to the
Safari Zone
, a park that attracts Trainers from across the region.

It's not long before you catch a glimpse of
Team Magma
OR
/
Team Aqua
AS
. These Grunts are in a rush to reach
Mt. Pyre
, and take off to the south. It seems that they intend to claim a treasure before the other team can do so.
Safari Zone
The Safari Zone
The
Safari Zone
gives Trainers a chance to encounter all kinds of Pokémon. An admission fee was required in the past, but the park is now supported by volunteers and entry is free. The varied terrain means that some areas are only accessible by
Acro Bike
,
Mach Bike
, or both. It's necessary to switch between Bikes to fully explore the park, but you aren't yet able to carry both models at once.

On 1F, talk to the old woman in the southwest corner. Concerned for your safety, she gives you a
Cleanse Tag
, which reduces the wild encounter rate when held by your lead Pokémon.
On 3F, you can collect two types of
Incense
. The
Lax Incense
boosts the holder's
evasiveness
by 10%. The
Sea Incense
gives
Water
moves a 20% power boost when held. These also allow
Wobbuffet
,
Marill
, and
Azumarill
to produce
Wynaut
and
Azurill
Eggs at the Day Care.
4F houses a large memorial to all the departed Pokémon interred here. Pick up
TM30
(
Shadow Ball
) and the
Medichamite
, then return to 3F and take the south exit.
Exterior
Reaching the summit means a long climb up the mountainside. Be sure to collect
TM61
(
Will-O-Wisp
) and the
Max Potion
before moving on.
Summit
When you reach the summit, you are finally able to catch up to
Team Magma
OR
/

. Show no mercy to the three Grunts lining the path as you advance northward. Upon reaching the mountain's highest peak, you witness
Maxie
OR
/
Archie
AS
stealing the
Red Orb
OR
/
Blue Orb
AS
from its altar! Like your last meeting atop
Mt. Chimney
, he doesn't have much time to waste on you. He claims that with this Orb, he no longer needs the power of the
Meteorite
to awaken the super-ancient Pokémon—he only needs a way to reach the place where it sleeps. He orders the rest of the team to
Slateport City
, to commandeer a submarine moored at the harbor there. He quickly departs, leaving his Admin
Courtney
OR

Matt

to battle you in his place.

123 Go Fish is a supply store near the pond on the route's west side. You can't buy anything here, but you can get a
Gyaradosite
from the shack's guard dog, a
Poochyena
named Chomper, by giving it a good scratch. While you're here, tell the nearby Fisherman that you like
Magikarp
and he'll give you an
Eviolite
.
Berry Master's House
The
Berry Master
's house, and
the great Berry garden he tends
, are located near the route's west end. Talk to him to receive two Berries of the same name every day, chosen randomly:
Pomeg
,
Kelpsy
,
Qualot
,
Hondew
,
Grepa
,
Tamato
,
Cornn
,
Magost
,
Rabuta
, or
Nomel
.
The
Berry Master's wife
will give out a Berry each day as well, but the type depends on whether you can help her recall the rest of a phrase. Incorrect answers will result in a common type of Berry—
Cheri
,
Chesto
,
Pecha
,
Rawst
,
Aspear
,
Leppa
,
Oran
,
Persim
,
Lum
, or
Sitrus
—while correct answers will earn a rarer variety. Answers are case-sensitive. After recalling all five phrases, she will hand out one common Berry every day.
