Mossdeep City
Mossdeep City
Mossdeep City
stands perched on an island near
Hoenn
's eastern edge, where the winds are mild and the weather conditions are stable. This makes it the perfect place for launching rockets, and a perfect home for the
Mossdeep Space Center
. The
seventh Gym
in the
Hoenn League
, run by twin Gym Leaders, is located on the north side of the island, and
Steven
's house can be found on the island's northwest corner.

Badge Checker
Three Hex Maniac sisters can be found in the southeastern-most house. The one in the middle has a special power. By viewing any of your Badges, she is able to recall which Pokémon were in your party when you won that particular Badge.
Running Errands
Visit the house nearest the stairway to the Space Center to meet a young woman who uses a
Wingull
to send letters to a friend in
Fortree City
. Talk to the Wingull and it will take flight, off to deliver another note. If you return to Fortree and visit the Pokémon Breeder in the northeast house there, he will give you a
Mental Herb
that his Wingull found in its travels.
Score the Super Rod
The house nearest the Space Center's launchpad belongs to a lone Fisherman. Speak to him to receive the
Super Rod
, a high-end fishing rod that can reel in all kinds of sea life.
Mossdeep Space Center
The
Mossdeep Space Center
stands on a hill in the northeast. Check out the exhibits inside, and take a seat near the windows for some interesting views. A Sailor near the viewing area will give you a
Sun Stone
he found on the beach.
Mossdeep Gym
Mossdeep City Pokémon Gym
Leaders: Liza & Tate
The mystic combination!
The
Mossdeep Gym
specializes in
Psychic-type
Pokémon, which are vulnerable to
Bug
-,
Dark
-, and
Ghost-type
moves. Dark Pokémon are both immune to Psychic moves and able to inflict super-effective damage. Avoid using
Fighting
- and
Poison-type
Pokémon. The Gym is an eerie place, with several platforms floating over a seemingly endless void, connected by strings of energy. Each platform has a Trainer, and most platforms also feature a floating stone that must be activated to alter the direction of these energy trails and reach the next platform.
From the entrance, take the energy trail to the yellow southwest platform and Psychic Preston. Interact with the floating rock, then take the south trail back to the entrance. Take the northern trail again, this time to the orange southeast platform and Psychic Joshua. Activate the floating rock, then take the eastern trail to the green northeast platform and Psychic Fritz. After activating the rock here, you may optionally decide to take the northwest path to battle Hex Maniac Kindra on a smaller nearby platform; otherwise, take the western path to the gray northwest platform and Hex Maniac Patricia. Activating the rock here will open the path to the Gym Leaders, but you must return to the entrance first. From here, either detour to the southeast to fight the final Gym Trainer, Psychic Virgil, or simply head south to the yellow platform again. Head south again to the entrance, then north to reach the Gym Leaders' platform.
Twins
Liza and Tate
send out two Pokémon, drawing challengers into a
Double Battle
. Both of their Pokémon are weakened by
Water
moves; by using
Surf
, you can attack both at once and bring the battle to a quick end. Otherwise, you may want to target one Pokémon at a time in what would essentially become a two-on-one battle.

After the battle,
Liza and Tate
award you the
Mind Badge
, which ensures obedience from all Pokémon up to level 80 and enables the use of
Dive
in the field. The twins also give you
TM04
(
Calm Mind
) as a prize. Afterwards, step on the glowing panel to warp to the entrance.
Earthquake!
A great rumble rocks the city when you step outside, and a giant pillar of green and yellow light is seen bursting up from the sea to the south. Spotting you through the crowd of terrified residents,
Steven
races over and asks you to his home. Inside, he confirms that
Team Magma
OR
/
Team Aqua
AS
has successfully breached the
Seafloor Cavern
. The cave's entrance was sealed since ancient times by the power of
a certain Pokémon
; with the seal broken, the team aims to revive the super-ancient Pokémon inside and make its power their own. Steven resolves to do everything he can to quell the situation, but admits there is a limit to what he can do alone, and asks for your help. He entrusts you with
HM07
(
Dive
) so you can reach the submarine cavern, as well as the
Devon Scuba Gear
to ensure your safety underwater. He then encourages you to visit
Route 128
and pursue the villains inside the cavern.
Route 125
Route 125
Located north of
Mossdeep City
,
Route 125
is an optional area with several Secret Spots. The waterlogged
Shoal Cave
stands in the route's center.

Shoal Cave
Connected to the ocean, the appearance of
Shoal Cave
changes with the
tides
. Seawater floods the cave during high tide, closing off some areas and opening others. It then drains away during low tide, revealing new areas for exploration, some of which require the
Mach Bike
to reach. The tides change every six hours, at 3:00 and 9:00.

Entrance
An old man in the entry chamber offers to make a
Shell Bell
for your Pokémon. But first, he needs you to collect some of the cave's natural resources:
Shoal Shells
and
Shoal Salts
. These items are replenished each day, so there's no limit to the number you can collect. Once you hand over four of each item, he crafts the health-restoring item for you. Surf northwest and take the doorway there to reach the next chamber.
Second Cavern
Surf along the water in a clockwise direction, collecting the four Shoal Shells and
Rare Candy
on the way. Take the southeast doorway back to the entrance, where you can collect a
Big Pearl
on the nearby ledge.
Low tide
Entrance
An old man in the entry chamber offers to make a
Shell Bell
for your Pokémon. But first, he needs you to collect some of the cave's natural resources:
Shoal Shells
and
Shoal Salts
. These items are replenished each day, so there's no limit to the number you can collect. Once you hand over four of each item, he crafts the health-restoring item for you. Head through the north doorway to reach the next chamber.
Second Cavern
Head up the stairway, go north and climb down the east-central ladder.
Fourth Cavern
Grab the Shoal Salt and
Ice Heal
, then climb the hill to the ladder in the northwest.
Second Cavern
Go west then south along the two bridges, then climb down the ladder in the center.
Third Cavern
Head east to meet a Black Belt and receive a
Focus Band
from him. Continue east to find another Shoal Salt, then jump the ledge to the south. Use the
Mach Bike
to climb the sandy slopes to the east in order to reach
TM79
(
Frost Breath
). Slide down the slope on the other side, then descend the ladder to the south.
Ice Cavern
The final cavern is permanently encased in ice, and the slick floors hinder travel.
