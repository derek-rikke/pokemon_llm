Littleroot Town
Home
When the Delta Episode concludes, you awaken in your room the day after the Litleonid shower. Head downstairs and Norman hands you a letter from
Mr. Briney
that contains an
S.S. Ticket
. With this, you can ride
Captain Stern
's new ferry! Norman suggests taking the ferry from either
Slateport
or
Lilycove
on the way to the
Battle Resort
, a busy island in the southeast part of Hoenn.
Head back home and talk to Mom. She hands you a Mega Stone that she discovered in the yard this morning, a
Latiasite
OR
/
Latiosite
AS
. Last night's Litleonid shower has left new Mega Stones all over Hoenn. Be sure to watch for new sparkling spots that betray their presence!

Step outside to again hear the shrill screams of Professor Birch. This time, it's a
Machoke
chasing after him. Grab a Poké Ball from the professor to help him out, and once again he lets you keep the Pokémon you chose. This one's from the distant
Unova
region!

Slateport City/Lilycove City
That's all the fun there is to be had around Littleroot, and besides, that
S.S. Ticket
is burning a hole in your Bag! Fly or Soar to either
Slateport
or
Lilycove
, then head to the harbor building. Present your ticket to the woman near the ferry, and she'll ask where you'd like to go. The
Battle Resort
beckons, but select either Lilycove or Slateport first and you'll be able to explore the
S.S. Tidal
during your voyage.
Aarune rematch
After you become the champion, you can rematch with Aarune in Fortree City's Secret Base Guild. His
Flygon
is now level 53, and it has stronger moves.

As you climb aboard, you'll find that you have arrived just in time to see a happy reunion between Mr. Briney and Drake of the Elite Four. The two sailors seem to know each other well, and take a moment to catch up before Drake steps out to enjoy the sea breeze.
There are eight cabins on the main floor, four on either side of the hallway. Three cabins on each side hold Trainers who are anxious to battle. On the north side, the second cabin from the left is your own, with a bed where you can rest your Pokémon. On the south side, the farthest cabin to the right holds a Bug Maniac; he's too startled to battle you, but gives you
TM63
(
Embargo
) instead.
Deck
After exploring the cabins, go left and head outside to soak up some sun on the ship's deck. Check the sparkling spot up north to find a new Mega Stone, the
Blastoisinite
. Drake stands on the bow, taking in the sight of the ocean's rolling majesty.
Storage
Head back inside toward the entrance and head downstairs to visit the ship's spacious storage. There's plenty of room for Pokémon battles to play out, and the two hardworking Sailors here will happily oblige. Speak to the Backpacker to the south, and reassure him that you can understand his rough speech, to receive a
Sharp Beak
. Be sure to search behind the crates in the northwest corner to discover some
Leftovers
, as well.
