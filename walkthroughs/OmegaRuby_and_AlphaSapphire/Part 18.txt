Mauville City
When you return to
Mauville
, you find
Wattson
standing near the Square Tower in the central courtyard. He explains that the tower acts as an alert system for
New Mauville
, an abandoned underground facility on
Route 110
. The illuminated tower indicates that there may be a disturbance in New Mauville, and Wattson asks you to his
Mauville Hills
apartment to discuss the matter further.
Mauville Hills
Mauville Hills
is a high-end apartment complex located on the city's second floor. These plush accommodations are leased only to Mauville's most elite residents, but as
Wattson
has updated your security clearance, you are free to come and go. The second floor can be reached by taking either elevator on the city's north side.

North Hall
Apartment 1
, in the northwest, belongs to the Rotation Frump. This old woman, named Circie, used to be a great
Rotation Battler
years ago. She offers to battle you once per day with this unique format; defeat her, and her granddaughter will give you an
Elixir
each time.
Apartment 2
, in the northeast, is the home of the Ribbon Belle. Speak to her to receive enough copies of a certain Ribbon for your entire party; the type received depends on the day of the week. By speaking to the other girl, you can receive the Best Friends Ribbon, as long as your lead Pokémon is affectionate enough toward you.
East Hall
Apartment 3
, in the northeast, belongs to the
old guys
found in the city's Pokémon Center. After giving you each of their two
O-Powers
, they return here. Speak to the Storyteller after visiting the powerless man in Apt. 11, and he asks that you fetch the man. Speak to the powerless man to bring him to Apt. 3, where the old guys transfer their powers to their successor one by one. Once all five old guys have left, the powerless man becomes
Mr. Bonding
, who gives you the Hatching Power before leaving.
Apartment 11
, in the northwest, belongs to a businessman depressed with his lack of power. This home includes balcony access, where
TM89
(
U-turn
) can be found.
Apartment 12
, in the southwest, is home to a frightened man. This Collector is late on his rent payment, and is being harassed by a loan shark for his money. The two then enter the locked apartment for a brief conversation. Return a short time later to find the loan shark standing outside, where he hands you a
Lopunnite
he took as payment.
South Hall
Apartment 13
, Wattson's home, is located in the northeast. He asks you to investigate New Mauville, and press a button on the computer there to reset the security system. He then takes a photo of your eyes to submit to the facility's eye recognition software, clearing you as authorized personnel. You're all set to investigate, and Wattson advises you to Surf around
Route 110
to reach the building's entrance.
Apartment 14
, in the northwest, belongs to a little girl who is a big fan of ice cream. This Fairy Tale Girl offers to sell a
Casteliacone
for
$
200, but only to Trainers with a
Regice
in their party.
Route 110
New Mauville
New Mauville
New Mauville
was intended to be an underground city extending dozens of floors below the surface. However, the project died in development when it was discovered to be a habitat for wild Pokémon. The area emits a strong magnetic field that may cause
certain
Pokémon
to evolve.

Security Check
Once you explore the area, check the computer terminal in the back room to perform a security scan. This verifies that there are no unusual threats present in the facility. With your task complete, return to
Wattson
's apartment in Mauville Hills. Inform him that everything is all right in New Mauville, and the grateful Gym Leader rewards you with
TM24
(
Thunderbolt
).
