Located to the north of
Route 108
,
Sea Mauville
was once a high-tech base where scientists and engineers dredged for natural resources beneath the water's surface. The facility was abandoned once it became evident that it was slowly falling over into the waves. Once slated for demolition, the half-sunken structure now exists as a refuge for water-dwelling Pokémon, and a popular tourist attraction.

Exterior
Surf up to the facility and climb out of the water onto the sloped walkway. Upon doing so, the camera angle rotates 90° counter-clockwise to face westward. A guide stands at the corner to tell visitors about the facility. The Scientist here works for
Captain Stern
, and is looking for a certain item at the captain's request. He's searched all but the submerged parts of the facility and hasn't yet found it. Collect the nearby
Escape Rope
, and
TM18
(
Rain Dance
) on the farthest stairway. Enter the interior through the doorway near the Scientist.
Interior (Left)
Boxes and debris prevent you from reaching the north (right) hallway from here, so take the south (left) hallway instead. The two doors to the left are locked, and the room to the right only has two Trainers, Young Couple Lois & Hal. Walk to the water's edge to grab a
Max Repel
, then sail out across the water and dive beneath the surface.
Underwater Hallway
Go east (down) to reach a stairway leading to the control room.
Control Room
Inspect the area near the bottom of the lower-right stairway to find something glimmering faintly in the water. Pick it up to reveal the
Scanner
.
Underwater Hallway
Take the northwest (upper-right) hallway and return to the surface to reach the far side of the facility.
Interior (Right)
Climb out of the water and follow the hallway around the corner to collect a
White Herb
near the entrance. Talk to the female Tuber nearby to receive the
Key to Room 1
; which opens the upper-left door in the south (left) hallway.
An Uneasy Feeling
Visit the lower-left room on the way back to the submerged section. There seems to be nothing here, but you feel as if you're being watched. Save the game, then search the bookshelf in the room's top-left corner to find an old report about the facility's history. After reading this, you get the same feeling again. Check your party or open your Bag so that the top screen is covered by a menu. Close the menu to find that an
Odd Keystone
has suddenly appeared behind you!

Interior (Left)
Room 1 contains Mysterious Sisters Scall & Ion, as well as a
Dive Ball
. Examine the filing cabinet on the left side of the room to obtain the
Key to Room 2
, which opens the lower-left door in this same hallway.
Room 2 contains a
Revive
and two Teammates. Speak to the girl on the right to receive the
Key to Room 6
, which opens the upper-right door in the north (right) hallway.
Interior (Right)
Room 6 holds nothing of interest aside from an exterior door on the far side of the room.
Exterior (Right)
Surf to the isle to the north (right) of the facility. Ask the Fisherman here if he's caught anything, and he gives you the
Key to Room 4
. This opens the upper-left room in the north (right) hallway.
Interior (Right)
Return to the interior of the facility and open the door to Room 4. Inside, you find the
Storage Key
, which opens an exterior door.
Storage Hold
After passing through Room 6 again, Surf west (up) from the Fisherman to reach a door marked,
Storage
. The room holds a dozen items scattered across the floor. A Street Thug enters just after you, and intends to make off with these treasures. Suddenly, an old man, who the Street Thug calls Uncle Raikoh, enters. It seems at first that both men are after the goods, but the old man is only interested in a
Skitty
doll that he calls
Takao
. Once the two men leave, you are free to collect the
Luxury Ball
, four
Nuggets
, eight
Big Nuggets
, and
TM13
(
Ice Beam
). A sparkling spot in the lower-left corner denotes a Mega Stone; Surf around the boxes to reach the
Beedrillite
.
Hunting a Legend
Talk to the Scientist again, and he asks that you deliver the Scanner to Captain Stern back in
Slateport
. Hand it off to Stern in the harbor, and he rewards you with the
Clear Bell
OR
/
Tidal Bell
AS
, which features in some old legends in the far-off
Johto
region. Stern says he would sometimes see it glow when visiting Sea Mauville.
VS Ho-Oh
OR
Climb the slanted deck of the facility and the Clear Bell in your Bag begins to glow. Head up the incline to the platform's edge, then walk along one of the metal beams protruding over the water. A mysterious ring floats at the beam's end. Save the game, then examine this ring to reveal the legendary
Ho-Oh
! If you fail to catch it, Ho-Oh will reappear once you enter the
Hall of Fame

The second floor is darker than the first. Go north to get a

, then east between the two ponds. In the southeast, you run into
Flannery
, who is also looking for the rare Pokémon. She's not quite up to the task, and heads back to
Lavaridge
to better prepare herself. Take the nearby stairs down to the next level.
B2F
B2F is shaped like two large rings, with an upper level and lower level. Collect the hidden
Nugget
on the lower level's east side, and the hidden
Super Potion
on the upper level's west side. Go down the southern of the two western stairways, then head south to find a
Charizardite Y
. Climb up the northern of the two western stairways, then down the northwest stairway. Push the boulder into place to create a shortcut, then go down the stairs to the north.

The oppressive heat of the final floor means simply breathing is difficult. Save the game and examine the mysterious ring floating near the north wall to reveal the legendary
