Whether you returned to
Mauville
with
May
/
Brendan
or took the long way through
Route 115
and
Rusturf Tunnel
, it is a good idea to visit
Rydel's Cycles
to swap your
Mach Bike
for the
Acro Bike
. The upcoming terrain is harsh, and while the Mach Bike can reach some areas, the Acro Bike allows you to fully explore the rough landscape without making multiple visits.
Route 112 (south)
Team Magma
OR
/
Team Aqua
AS
has taken
Professor Cozmo
's Meteorite to
Mt. Chimney
, and the only way to follow is by Cable Car. When you arrive, you find that the guards are no longer guarding the building. Collect the
Guard Spec.
to the east, then enter the station and take the Cable Car up to the summit.
Mt. Chimney
Mt. Chimney
Located in the heart of
Hoenn
,
Mt. Chimney
is a monstrous volcano that seethes with incredible power. Although their intentions are not yet clear,
Team Magma
OR
/
Team Aqua
AS
is determined to use
Professor Cozmo
's Meteorite here in the next stage of their campaign.

Steer Clear of the Grunts
Normally, visitors to the mountaintop would be able to head south through
Jagged Pass
to reach
Lavaridge Town
. But Team Magma and Team Aqua are locked in battle all over the summit, including the entrance to the mountain pass. Let their Pokémon fight it out while you climb up north to the crater.
West of the stairway, you find
Aqua Leader
Archie
OR
/
Magma Leader
Maxie
AS
in a skirmish against a group of opposing Grunts. You're only here for
Cozmo
's Meteorite, though, so slip past the battle and work your way to the northwest.
Spotted!
There is a single Grunt ahead standing guard, and you are quickly drawn into battle. But you're more than a match for one lowly Grunt, so finish him off quickly and continue northward.
Detour for a TM
Farther ahead is a glass bridge that extends over the mouth of the volcano. Ignore it for a moment and follow the narrow stairway instead. Loop around under the bridge to find
TM59
(
Incinerate
).
Challenge Accepted!
Make your way to the glass bridge and you'll be stopped by
Tabitha
OR
/
Shelly
AS
, who isn't about to let you pass by so easily!

With his defeat, Maxie
OR
/Archie
AS
threatens to
Mega Evolve
his Pokémon. But before he is able to draw you into another battle, he suddenly receives a call. After muttering something about
Mt. Pyre
, he unexpectedly gives up the
Meteorite
and leaves.
As you turn to leave, you are stopped by Archie
OR
/Maxie
AS
. He is shocked that his rival would hand over the Meteorite so easily, and seems fearful that the opposing team may have discovered where some important-sounding "orbs" are hidden. He then sets off to plan his team's next move.
Jagged Pass
Jagged Pass
Jagged Pass
was formed as the result of an ancient volcanic eruption. When the lava cooled, it proved to be suitable for an alternate route to the summit. Many parts are too rough or slippery to traverse without a Bicycle.

Lavaridge Town
Lavaridge Town
Nestled at the foot of
Mt. Chimney
,
Lavaridge Town
is a welcome sight for travelers and tourists alike. It is well-known throughout
Hoenn
for its soothing hot springs, said to cure any ailment, and also features a specialty shop that sells bitter but beneficial
herbs
for Pokémon. The
Lavaridge Gym
, fourth in the
Hoenn League
, stands in the southwest part of town.

Communicating Through Dance
As you enter the town, you find a Black Belt standing outside the Poké Mart. He has a passion for dancing and karate, but his communication skills leave something to be desired. Disagree when he asks if you understand his words, and he will give you
TM75
(
Swords Dance
) in the hopes that the "Suh-words Dance" move will help you comprehend.
Pokémon Center and Hot Springs
A Pokémon Breeder standing next to the counter is selling bottles of
Moomoo Milk
for
$
500 each. Bottles can be purchased individually, or by the dozen for
$
6,000. This nutritious milk restores 100 HP and is cheaper than a Super Potion, which only restores 50 points.
The building's two back doors lead to the steamy hot springs. Take a dip if you wish, and use the Dowsing Machine to find a hidden
Ice Heal
behind the door on the right. Afterward, use the PC to organize your party so that you are carrying no more than five Pokémon. Step outside and talk to the old woman near the sand baths, and she offers you a Pokémon Egg to take with you on your travels!
Herb Shop
At the
Herb Shop
, a woman sells
herbal medicines
for Pokémon. These natural remedies are just as effective as their traditional counterparts and less expensive, but their bitter taste make them difficult for Pokémon to take, leaving them less
friendly
toward you. As
Max Revives
cannot be purchased anywhere, it may be useful to buy a few
Revival Herbs
to have in case of an emergency.
Heal Powder
$
450
Energy Powder

Be sure to talk to the old man near the counter, as well. Doing so gets you a
Charcoal
, which boosts the power of
Fire-type
moves by 20% when held.
Lavaridge Gym
Lavaridge Gym, 1F
Lavaridge Town Pokémon Gym
Leader: Flannery
One with a fiery passion that burns!
Like the name suggests, the
Lavaridge Gym
specializes in
Fire-type
Pokémon.
Grass
-,
Bug
-,
Ice
-, and
Steel-type
Pokémon are most vulnerable to their scorching attacks, while
Water
,
Ground
, and
Rock
moves will give you the upper hand.
Wingull
and
Pelipper
are great Pokémon to bring to this Gym; not only are they Water types, but as
Flying
types they also have an advantage against Battle Girl Sadie's
Meditite
. The
Psychic-type
Ralts
can also help wear down the occasional
Koffing
found here. The humid Gym features two floors; stepping on a wooden panel will cause you to fall to the basement, and doing the same there will send you back to the first floor atop a geyser.
Step on the first trapdoor to fall through, then step on the panel to the right to return to 1F. Fight Kindler Cole and drop through the next trapdoor. Go west to battle Ninja Boy Hiromichi and take the far-left geyser. Head north past Kindler Axle and Battle Girl Sadie and drop through the northern-most trapdoor to B1F. Pass by the concealed Ninja Boy Shoji and ride the far-right geyser. Drop through the trapdoor south of Ace Trainer Zane. Battle Kindler Andy, then take the last geyser up to meet the Gym Leader.
Flannery
has only recently begun serving as Gym Leader, and is intent on proving her worth. Given the chance, her Pokémon can unleash powerful moves that can reduce a challenger's party to cinders.
Sunny Day
gives a 50% power boost to all Fire attacks, which makes her Pokémon's strongest move,
Overheat
, even more devastating. Its only drawback is that it harshly lowers the user's
Special Attack
after each use, but once is usually enough! In addition, the harsh sunlight temporarily cuts the power of Water attacks in half.

After the battle, Flannery awards you the
Heat Badge
, which ensures obedience of all Pokémon up to level 50 and enables the use of
Strength
in the field. She also hands out
TM50
(
Overheat
) as a prize. Hop down the ledges in front of Flannery to quickly return to the entrance. Outside, May/Brendan is shocked that you managed to defeat Team Magma
OR
/Team Aqua
AS
on your own at
Mt. Chimney
. She/He hands you the
Go-Goggles
, which allow you to explore the desert of
Route 111
in spite of the raging sandstorm. Seeing your shiny new Badge, your friend concludes that your next stop is the Gym in
Petalburg City
. She/He happens to be headed to the same place, and invites you to travel with her/him. If you decline, you will have a chance to do some optional things before continuing on, and your friend will wait here patiently for a while if you change your mind.
