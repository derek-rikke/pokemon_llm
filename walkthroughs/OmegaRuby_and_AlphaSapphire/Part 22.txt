Pokémon League
Pokémon League Lobby
The
Pokémon League
building holds the traditional amenities. The Pokémon Center and PC are located to the left, while the Poké Mart is off to the right. It's a good idea to stock up on
Hyper Potions
,
Full Restores
, and
Full Heals
for the gauntlet ahead.
To increase your chances of victory, you may want to revisit the
Lilycove Department Store
and purchase some
battle items
. These items temporarily raise one of a Pokémon's stats during battle. Using a single
X Defense
or
X Sp. Def
will boost the respective stat by 50%. Using two is equal to a 100% boost, so the Pokémon sustains half the normal amount of damage.
Dire Hits
can be useful as well, as using two or more drastically raises the odds of getting a
critical hit
. In addition, using a
Guard Spec.
protects your Pokémon from stat reduction for five turns.
With your preparations complete, talk to the two Ace Trainers guarding the double doors in the room's center. They verify that you've earned all eight
Hoenn League
Badges before stepping aside, allowing you to enter the depths of the Pokémon League. Challengers must face the
Elite Four
and
Champion
in quick succession, with no outside help. Step through the door to reach the first chamber.
Elite Four
Battle 1: Sidney
Sidney's room
The first member of the Elite Four is
Sidney
, a master
Dark-type
Trainer. His Pokémon are all vulnerable to
Bug
-,
Fighting
-, and
Fairy-type
attacks, and immune to
Psychic
moves.
He leads with his
Mightyena
, which lowers the opponent's Attack with its
Intimidate
Ability. It may also use
Swagger
to confuse the target while raising its Attack, in the hopes that it will wear itself down. Use a
Persim Berry
to cure confusion, or use a special attacker to bypass Intimidate.
Shiftry
is a
Grass
/
Dark
-type, doubly vulnerable to Bug moves.
Leaf Blade
is its strongest move, but can retaliate against Fighting Pokémon with
Extrasensory
. Take it out by exploiting one of its many weaknesses. His
Sharpedo
can be dangerous due to its high Attack and Speed, but its low defenses mean you can make quick work of it.
Crunch
is its strongest attack, but it can also use
Aqua Jet
to strike first.
Poison Fang
also allows it to fight back against Grass and Fairy Pokémon.
Cacturne
, like Shiftry, has several weaknesses, but may be a bit trickier to take down.
Leech Seed
lets it slowly sap the target's health to restore its own, and
Spiky Shield
both protects the user for a turn and inflicts damage if the target attacks with a move that makes contact. Target one of its many weaknesses to knock it out quickly. Last up is his
Absol
; its high Attack means that any of its moves can pack a punch.
Slash
,
Night Slash
, and
Psycho Cut
each have an increased critical-hit ratio to begin with, but its
Super Luck
Ability raises the odds even further. Its defenses are mediocre, so use your strongest moves to keep up the pressure and take it down.

Battle 2: Phoebe
Phoebe's room
The second member of the Elite Four is
Phoebe
, a master
Ghost-type
Trainer. Her Pokémon are generally vulnerable to
Ghost
- and
Dark-type
moves, and immune to
Normal
and
Fighting
moves except by a Pokémon which had previously used
Foresight
or
Odor Sleuth
.
She leads with her
Dusclops
, a defensive Ghost Pokémon that is more interested in status ailments than direct attacks.
Confuse Ray
triggers confusion, which may force the target to attack itself.
Curse
forces it to sacrifice half of its health to lay a curse on the target, which wears away 25% of its maximum health every turn; however, switching your Pokémon out lifts the curse. Use Ghost and Dark attacks to take it down.
Sableye
normally has only one weakness:
Fairy
moves. If your team doesn't have any, then you won't be able to rely on type match-ups right now. Alternatively, if a Pokémon uses
Foresight
or
Odor Sleuth
, it can successfully use
Fighting
-type moves. Sableye often leads with
Fake Out
, which causes the target to flinch.
Shadow Claw
and
Power Gem
deal damage, but
Foul Play
can be more dangerous; it calculates damage by using the target's Attack, so don't use a physical fighter against it if you can avoid it. Phoebe has two
Banette
on her team; one male, one female. The male can wear the target's health away with
Toxic
. If
Grudge
is used the turn before being knocked out, it depletes the Power Points of the move that did so. The female can use
Will-O-Wisp
to burn the target and cut its Attack in half, while
Spite
gradually wears away the target's Power Points. Both can use
Shadow Ball
, and can cause minor additional damage with
Psychic
and
Feint Attack
, respectively. Lastly, her
Dusknoir
has better-than-average Attack power, but poor Speed. It has access to
Fire Punch
,
Ice Punch
, and
Thunder Punch
; not only do these allow it to deal super-effective damage against a wide variety of Pokémon, the target may end up Burned, Frozen, or Paralyzed. Its final move,
Hex
, doubles in power when used against a target with any of these status ailments. Take it down with strong Ghost- or Dark-type attacks to win the battle.

Battle 3: Glacia
Glacia's room
The third member of the Elite Four is
Glacia
, a master
Ice-type
Trainer. Her Pokémon are vulnerable to
Rock
-,
Fire
-, and
Fighting-type
attacks.
She leads with her first
Glalie
, which tends to start things off with
Hail
. With Hail in effect,
Blizzard
's accuracy rises to 100%, and Pokémon with the
Snow Cloak
Ability gain a 25% boost to their evasion. In addition, all non-Ice-types take residual damage for five turns. Glalie's
Light Screen
temporarily reduces the damage taken from Special moves, so moves like
Flamethrower
are less effective. Its other moves aren't much of a problem, so this may be a good opportunity for set-up moves like
Swords Dance
. Her second Glalie is much the same; however, it wields
Protect
in place of Light Screen. It also knows
Freeze-Dry
, a strong Ice attack that deals super-effective damage to
Water
Pokémon. As with the first, take it out at your leisure. Glacia also commands two nearly-identical
Froslass
. The first carries
Confuse Ray
and
Ominous Wind
, making it a more defensive fighter. The second has
Draining Kiss
and
Shadow Ball
instead, giving it better coverage. Both carry Hail, Blizzard, and the Snow Cloak Ability to abuse the weather conditions. If you brought along the super-ancient Pokémon, its Primal form can completely shut down any hailstorm. Glacia's biggest threat is
Walrein
, an
Ice
/
Water
Pokémon. Its high HP, Defense, and Special Defense means that not even super-effective moves will take it down easily. Decent offensive stats allow it to deal respectable damage with
Surf
, Blizzard, and
Body Slam
.
Sheer Cold
instantly knocks out the target if it hits, but only works on a target of a lower level than the user. Use
Grass
or
Electric
moves to take it down quickly.

Battle 4: Drake
Drake's room
The fourth and final member of the Elite Four is
Drake
, a master
Dragon-type
Trainer. His Pokémon are all vulnerable to Dragon- and
Fairy-type
attacks, while most are also vulnerable to
Ice
moves.
Drake leads with his
Altaria
, a defensively-oriented Pokémon.
Cotton Guard
can boost its Defense by a staggering three stages, so special attacks are the better choice. As a
Dragon
/
Flying
Pokémon, it takes massive damage from moves like
Ice Beam
. His
Kingdra
is a
Water
/
Dragon
Pokémon, so you won't be able to exploit a weakness to Ice. It can deal serious damage with
Dragon Pulse
,
Surf
, and Ice Beam, so take it down quickly with Dragon or Fairy attacks or the Ice-type move
Freeze-Dry
which causes 4× damage (as it reverses the Water-type's resistant damage from Ice-type moves into super-effective damage). Drake's team features two
Flygon
; one male, one female. The male uses strong physical moves, like
Earthquake
, to deal heavy damage, and may confuse the target with
Supersonic
. The female uses strong special moves, like
Flamethrower
, instead.
Screech
lets it cut the target's Defense in half, though it has no physical moves to use. Both Pokémon are extremely vulnerable to Ice attacks. Drake's final Pokémon is
Salamence
, a Dragon/Flying type. It has high Attack, better-than-average Speed, and respectable defenses. Its
Intimidate
Ability weakens physical attackers, so special attackers, especially those with Ice moves, will have the advantage here. Its powerful attacks give it wide coverage, though nothing should pose a threat to any Fairy-type Pokémon.

Defeating the Elite Four has earned you the right to challenge Hoenn's reigning Champion. It is important to note that you will be drawn into battle immediately upon entering the final room, so take a moment to tend to your Pokémon and save your progress before moving on.
Champion
Champion's room
Inside the Champion's hall, you find your mentor
Steven
waiting for you. It seems that you've been sharing adventures with Hoenn's Champion all along! Steven is curious to know how much you've learned in your travels, and asks that you battle him with all your might. He promises to do the same with his Pokémon, as well. The stage is set for a legendary showdown! As Champion, Steven is well aware of the benefits of a diverse Pokémon team. His Pokémon are of many different types, and don't share nearly as many weaknesses as the Elite Four's teams. However, he still prefers his beloved
Steel
types, and most of his Pokémon are either part-
Rock
or part-
Ground
types—no surprise from this well-known stone collector. With such a varied team, you'll need to switch out your Pokémon as needed to capitalize on the weaknesses of Steven's Pokémon.
Steven leads with
Skarmory
, a
Steel
/
Flying
Pokémon with very high Defense; this makes physical attacks very ineffective. In addition, its
Sturdy
Ability allows it to survive at least one strong move that would knock it out with one hit. Skarmory likes to set up with
Spikes
, which damages any opposing grounded Pokémon switching in. By setting three layers, the opponent loses 25% of their maximum HP on the switch.
Toxic
can be very disruptive as well, as it
badly poisons
the target. Its other moves,
Aerial Ace
and
Steel Wing
, aren't very threatening. Strike with special-based
Fire
and
Electric
attacks to inflict serious damage.
Next up is his
Claydol
, a
Ground
/
Psychic
Pokémon. Claydol plays a defensive role, using
Reflect
and
Light Screen
to lessen the amount of damage sustained from physical and special attacks, respectively. This can make any progress very difficult to achieve while these effects are active.
TM12
(
Taunt
) can prevent these status moves for a few turns, while
TM31
(
Brick Break
) lifts their effects before dealing damage.
Earth Power
and
Extrasensory
are strong attacks, but it can't make good use of them due to its mediocre offenses. Target it with
Water
-,
Grass
-, or
Dark-type
moves to keep up the pressure.
His
Aggron
, a
Steel
/
Rock
Pokémon, has an incredibly high Defense. Like Skarmory, its
Sturdy
Ability prevents a one-hit knockout. Steven also has three
Full Restore
at his disposal, and will likely use one to heal a weakened Aggron. Its Attack is very high, and can deal serious damage with any of its moves.
Earthquake
and
Stone Edge
provide near-universal coverage, while
Iron Tail
may lower the target's Defense, allowing it to deal even more damage. It also knows
Dragon Claw
for good measure, so avoid sending out
Latios
OR
or
Latias
AS
against it. Chip away with weaker attacks at first before dealing massive damage with
Fighting
and
Ground
moves.
Next is his
Cradily
, a very defensive
Rock
/
Grass
Pokémon. Though it may not deal serious damage, it can still harass the opponent with
Confuse Ray
and
Giga Drain
, which steals the target's health for itself.
Ancient Power
may raise each of its stats by one stage, and
Sludge Bomb
may poison the target. Be quick to counter its status conditions, and strike back with
Bug
,
Fighting
,
Ice
, or
Steel
attacks.
His
Armaldo
is an unusual
Rock
/
Bug
Pokémon. The biggest threats in its arsenal are
X-Scissor
and
Rock Blast
, which both receive a
same-type attack bonus
.
Metal Claw
has a 10% chance of raising its Attack by one stage, while
Crush Claw
has a 50% chance of lowering the target's Defense by the same amount. Use items like
X Defense
or moves like
Reflect
to boost your Defense and overcome the effects of Crush Claw. Its seldom-seen typing leaves it vulnerable to moves of only a few different types. Use
Water
-, Rock-, and
Steel-type
attacks to exploit its weaknesses and knock it out.
Finally, Steven sends out his heaviest hitter:
Metagross
, a high-level
Steel
/
Psychic
Pokémon. After sending it out, Steven immediately triggers its
Mega Evolution
. Mega Metagross enjoys a boosted Attack, Special Defense, and Speed, making it far more powerful. As if that weren't intimidating enough, its
Tough Claws
Ability raises the power of all four of its
contact
moves by 33%.
Bullet Punch
strikes first and hard, thanks to Tough Claws and a same-type attack bonus. Should it choose power over speed,
Meteor Mash
is a strong attack that may raise the user's Attack, allowing it to strike even harder.
Zen Headbutt
is another STAB-boosted move, while
Giga Impact
deals heavy damage but forces it to recharge for a turn. It may be a good idea to inflict a
Burn
, both for its lingering damage and its Attack penalty. Otherwise, hammer away with your strongest special-based
Fire
,
Ground
,
Ghost
, and
Dark
attacks to claim the knockout and the battle.

With the battle concluded, Steven congratulates you on your impressive victory. He also thanks you for the hard-fought battle, and for demonstrating all you've learned. Just as he is about to crown you the new Hoenn League Champion, May/Brendan rushes in with some advice for challenging the Champion, only to find that you've already done so.
Professor Birch
arrives not long after, and congratulates you as well.
Hall of Fame
Steven then leads you into the
Hall of Fame
, where all Champions are honored. He asks that you set your Poké Balls in the machine here, so that your name and those of your Pokémon can be recorded for posterity. During the process, a shot of each fighter appears briefly on-screen. When you leave the Hall of Fame, you are greeted by May/Brendan in the Champion's room. Your friend waited so that she/he could accompany you back to
Littleroot Town
. The credits begin to roll, and images of several key battles are shown along the way.
Route 103
When the credits end, you find yourself back on
Route 103
, where you first battled May/Brendan. Your friend then challenges you to one last battle, for old times' sake. Her/His team is the same as the last time you battled in
Lilycove City
, with the addition of a
Raichu
and her/his
first partner Pokémon
's item. No experience is won from this battle, and nothing happens if you lose.
