Poké Radar
The
Poké Radar
that
Professor Rowan
gave you lets you catch some special Pokémon in the grass, which normally won't appear. Some grass will rustle or flash. If you catch or defeat a Pokémon in rustling or flashing grass, other patches of grass will rustle or flash. If you run from the Pokémon or if the grass has rustled/flashed 3 times in a use, the Radar will stop. To activate it again, run around for a while. Similar to
Vs. Seeker
, the Poké Radar needs to recharge, but it only requires 50 steps instead of 100.

Routes 219-221
You'll need to bring a Pokémon with
Surf
.
Head south from
Sandgem Town
. Go through these routes to head to
Pal Park
. If you haven't gone through this route before, fight all Trainers (though you'll probably overwhelm them) and collect all items now. Refer to Section 13 for details.
Pal Park
A map of Pal Park with the different areas highlighted
As soon as you reach Pal Park,
Professor Oak
will meet up with you and explain that Pal Park is now open and how you can use it. He will also give you a
Pokétch
App Trainer Counter, then leave to
Eterna City
.
If you restart the game, you will notice that there is an extra option in the menu, 'Migrate from [whatever Pokémon game is in the GBA slot]'. This will allow you to transfer Pokémon from either
Pokémon Ruby, Sapphire
,
Emerald
,
FireRed, or LeafGreen
. If you have done so, you may greet the ranger at the counter and enter Pal Park. This will begin an event called a Catching Show. Depending on the Pokémon you transfer over, they will appear in different zones of the park (a water Pokémon will appear in the Lake or the Sea). After you catch all the Pokémon, you can leave the park and meet the ranger again. He will end the Catching Show and give you a score. The score is based on how long it took you to catch all the Pokémon and the rarity of the Pokémon you transfer over.
From now on, you can fly here without going through Routes 219-221 again.
Dual-slot
After first accessing Pal Park, another method of catching Pokémon from previous generations has unlocked. This is the
Dual-slot mode
, also known as Dongle Method. Slot in a
Generation
III
game in the Slot 2 (
Game Boy Advance
slot) on your
Nintendo DS
or
Nintendo DS Lite
, and some Pokémon will appear on certain routes. Since this feature is inaccessible with the later DS models, your only choice in that situation is to receive these Pokémon from trades through
Platinum
as well as
HeartGold and SoulSilver
.
