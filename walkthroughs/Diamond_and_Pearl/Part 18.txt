Raiding Galactic HQ (Part 2)
VS Galactic Boss
Make sure that you go back to Team Galactic Nap Room and heal your Pokémon by taking a nap before proceeding!
Now that you have healed up, go to the door again. Step forward. Guess who? The boss is
Cyrus
, the man that you met in
Mt. Coronet
and
Celestic Town
! Remember that he was seeking a power that can make a new world? He says that he already knows that you are coming to rescue the
Lake guardians
. Then he turns around, and continues, saying that you are remarkable and your emotions are "pitifully useless". He swears,
"I will make you regret paying heed to your heart!"
Then he steps forward, challenging you to a battle!

He has three Pokémon:
Murkrow
,
Golbat
and
Sneasel
. Due to their types,
Rock-type
moves will destroy his whole team without much effort. However,
Fighting-type
moves are far more effective when dealing with the speedy but fragile Sneasel, which, at level 43, is also Cyrus' strongest Pokémon. Be careful of Sneasel's
Slash
, which has a high critical hit ratio, as well as
Ice Punch
, which can freeze your Pokémon. Take it out fast, because it can lower your defense with
Screech
before striking hard with its physical attacks. You should know how to deal with Golbat, but watch out for its
Poison Fang
, which has the potential to badly poison your Pokémon. The first Pokémon he sends out-- Murkrow, is a
Dark
/
Flying
-type Pokémon. One of its moves,
Embargo
, prevents you from using items on your Pokémon, so knock Murkrow out as soon as possible. The weaknesses of its Dark type are covered, so aim at the weaknesses of the Flying type.
After Cyrus is defeated, he continues his rant. He knows that your power comes from compassion towards Pokémon, but he believes that compassion is only "wasteful illusions". He also says that he neither makes Pokémon friends or partners like you, nor uses them as tools like other Team Galactic members. Instead, he makes the power of Pokémon his own. Then he recognizes that you are strong and courageous. He gives you the ultimate Poké Ball: the
Master Ball
, which he doesn't need, as your reward for the victory. He steps to the right and tells you to take the warp panel ahead to save the Lake guardians. He also mentions that he is "off to
Mt. Coronet
" to ascend the mountain to its peak, not only to put an end to everything, but also bring about a new beginning for everything. Not sure? He confirms once more—
"That's correct. Mt. Coronet.
Where you and I first met."
He then leaves. Now collect the hidden
Nugget
with the help of your
Pokétch
's
Dowsing Machine
, check the PC, and return to the Nap Room to heal your Pokémon.
VS Saturn, Rescuing the Lake Guardians
Secret laboratory
Again, make sure that you go back to Team Galactic Nap Room and heal your Pokémon by taking a nap before proceeding!
Return to where you just battled Cyrus. Follow the direction in which he left. There are two cylinders that blocked the one-way exit, so don't think about going out— you still haven't rescued the Lake guardians. Use the warp panel. You will be teleported to a mysterious laboratory. Head all the way east, talk to the scientists along the way (don't worry; they won't fight you), then head inside.
You'll find that
Uxie
,
Mesprit
and
Azelf
are sealed in machines, showing you that they are suffering. Go to the machine between Mesprit and Azelf. You'll find
Commander
Saturn
. Talk to him, then he tells you that he can't believe his boss "let a kid like you come and go freely". He then challenges you to a battle as the revenge for his defeat in
Valor Cavern
.

Saturn's team has only gained a few levels. If you can beat Cyrus, Saturn's team will not be a big threat (unless you did not heal your Pokémon). But Saturn's Pokémon don't have a common weakness, unlike Cyrus' Pokémon, and Saturn's
Toxicroak
can use the
Bug-type
move
X-Scissor
to counter
Psychic-type
Pokémon.
After you defeat Saturn again, he steps aside and tells you to press the button. Press it to free the Lake guardians. He then tells you that Cyrus crafted a
Red Chain
from crystals he took from those three Pokémon. That Red Chain is what Cyrus needs to "shackle and create something on Mt. Coronet". But this is all Saturn knows.
Now, head back to where Cyrus left. The two cylinders are gone. Behind that spot, there is a green one-way warp panel which will take you directly to the ground floor. The exit is only a few steps away from you. Get out from the exit, and you'll find yourself back in Veilstone.
Next, you'll be following Team Galactic to
Mt. Coronet
-- the highest mountain in
Sinnoh
, as well as the place where you and Cyrus first met. But before proceeding,
you must do some preparation
to avoid failure.
Before proceeding......
You should know that you'll be going all the way to the peak of Mt. Coronet. Like
Route 216
, the summit area is under constant snow, and the snow will mysteriously change to
Hail
in battles, damaging all non-
Ice-type
Pokémon. The wild Pokémon are also stronger, reaching Level 40. Also, the
Town Map
will malfunction and only display where you enter Mt. Coronet, not your current location.
A long and tough journey is up ahead. You'll also face a
Legendary Pokémon
. To make sure you're prepared, check the following lists.
Useful items
Medicine
Buy a lot of medicine.
Buy at least 20 for each necessary medicine.
For example, bottles of
Hyper Potions
, pieces of
Revive
and
status condition healing items
(especially bottles of
Ice Heal
).
Buying 25 to 30 for each is recommended.
To save money, stock up on
Drinks
such as Fresh Water, Soda Pop, Lemonade and Moomoo Milk instead of
Super Potions
. By now, you should know where to buy the drinks, but in case you forgot:
Moomoo Milk is available at the
Café Cabin
on
Route 210
.
The other Drinks can be obtained from the
Vending Machines
on the
Veilstone Department Store
's top floor (5F).
Poke Balls
If you are playing Pokémon Diamond Version, buy at least 40
Ultra Balls
.
If you are playing Pokémon Pearl Version, buy at least 40
Net Balls
.
Available in the
Poké Mart
of
Eterna City
,
Hearthome City
and
Solaceon Town
.
In both games, if you are playing at night, you may also consider using
Dusk Balls
instead. Buy at least 40.
Available in the Poké Mart in Solaceon Town,
Pastoria City
and
Snowpoint City
.
Required HMs
Surf
Strength
Rock Smash
Rock Climb
Pokemon Conditions
Health
Heal your Pokémon.
You must do this first because your Pokémon are probably exhausted after raiding
Galactic HQ
.
Levels
Train your Pokémon until they are at or above Level 40.
Having your team around Level 45 is recommended.
If your Pokémon are at or below Level 40, don't even dare proceeding to the mountainside of Mt. Coronet!
Are you ready?
Once you know you're well prepared and your Pokémon are fully healed, it's time to save the world!

Oreburgh City

Route 207

If you went here to collect items after beating the

You'll need to start fighting

again. Head north, grab the hidden
Super Repel
, fight the grunts, follow the path, then go outside when you are ready to brace the snow.
WARNING! If your Pokémon are at or below Level 40, do not head outside! Train here until they are above Level 40. Otherwise, you'll get your Pokémon pulverized!
Mt. Coronet (Mountainside and Upper Caverns)
Mountainside
When you get to the mountainside and upper caverns, the background music completely changes, and you'll quickly realize that it is snowing. The snow is not as harsh as the blizzard on
Route 217
, but it can still obscure your view. Combined with the complicated geography, this can prove irritating. In battles, the snow will change into hail that damages all Pokémon that are not at least partially Ice-type.
There are many caverns to enter. Some of them let you proceed, and some of them are dead ends (for now). As the Town Map is malfunctioning, you will need to be very careful not to get lost. Most of the items you can get are hidden, so make sure that your Dowsing Machine is ready.
