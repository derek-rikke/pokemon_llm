In the Beginning......
When you first turn on the game,
Professor Rowan
introduces himself and says to just call him "the Pokémon Professor". He then asks if this is your first adventure and is willing to give advice as needed such as the basic control and adventure information. Then, he asks you to touch the button in the middle of the
Poké Ball
that appears on your DS' touch screen. A
Munchlax
then appears from the Poké Ball and Rowan goes on to speak about the human relationship alongside Pokémon as friends. He then states that his job as a professor is to conduct research on these Pokémon.
You are then asked if you are a boy or a girl, so choose wisely as you will be unable to change your gender once you have started your adventure. You then must choose a name, which will also stay with you for the remainder of the game. You are than asked what
your friend's
name is. He will be your rival. His official name is Barry, so from now on, he is referred as "Barry" in this walkthrough.
Your adventure has begun, so it's time to jump into the world of Pokémon!
Twinleaf Town
Twinleaf Town
The journey begins at your home in
Twinleaf Town
. You are watching the television special report titled "Search for the Red Gyarados!" in which a news broadcast describes a team searching for a
red Gyarados
in a far-off lake (which is presumably the
Lake of Rage
in
Johto
). The broadcast states that the team has not observed the Pokémon in question.
On your way out of the house, your
mother
will tell you that your rival wishes to see you as it is an emergency. She also warns you to stay out the tall grass as
wild Pokémon
may attack. Just as you enter his house, Barry bumps into you. He tells you to come with him to
Lake Verity
and says that he will fine
$
1 million if you aren't there. As he is about to leave, Barry notices that he has forgotten something and runs back inside the house. Head inside and upstairs, where Barry is deciding what to bring. He then notices you, threatens to fine you
$
10 million (which is 10 times of the original amount) and rushes out of the house. He will now be waiting for you on
Route 201
. Now head north to reach the route.
Route 201
Route 201
Your rival takes you to Lake Verity
Barry sees you and follows you. If you turn east and try to go through the tall grass, your Mom's words will suddenly pop out of nowhere and prevent you from entering tall grass. Head west and go to
Verity Lakefront
.
Verity Lakefront
This is a short path that leads you to the lake. Follow the path and head into Lake Verity. Once you can go to Route 201, you can get a hidden Potion here that is accessed from the route.

Lake Verity
After you reach Route 201, Barry tells you about the news report on TV about the Red Gyarados. He wants to go to the local lake to see if there is a similar Pokémon, and he will now follow you. Walk to
Lake Verity
. Upon your arrival, you see
Professor Rowan
, and either
Lucas
or
Dawn
(whoever is the opposite gender of your selected player character). The two are searching the lake for something and discuss Rowan's return to
Sinnoh
after four years. They push past you, and Lucas/Dawn apologizes. Barry goes to investigate the briefcase Rowan left behind, but when you enter the long grass you are each attacked by a wild
Starly
. You then open the briefcase to find three
Poké Balls
, containing
Turtwig
,
Chimchar
and
Piplup
.

When you choose one, that Pokémon will become your
first partner Pokémon
, and Barry will automatically select the one with a type advantage over yours. Choosing the correct first partner Pokémon for your style of battling is an important choice.
Turtwig, the Turtle Pokémon, is a solid choice. Turtwig evolves into
Grotle
at Level 18, and then Torterra at level 32. Turtwig is a
Grass-type
Pokémon, and
Torterra
is a Grass/
Ground
-type Pokémon. Torterra has great Attack and Defense, but low Special Attack and Speed. If you don't rely on Speed to win, and like physical attacks, this Pokémon is a good choice for you. It gets
Razor Leaf
and
Crunch
pretty early on, and Earthquake eventually. Torterra also gets Wood Hammer from the Move Tutor. Another good move for Torterra is Curse, which boosts its Attack and Defense, its two best stats, while decreasing its Speed, which is already very low. It also gets
Synthesis
for healing itself. For TM moves it gets
Bullet Seed
,
Return
,
Giga Impact
, and a wide range of other moves. Also it gets TM
Rock Polish
to sharply boost its Speed every time it is used, which helps patch up Torterra's horrific Speed stat.
Swords Dance
is also good to sharply boost the Attack stat, but you should choose to use either this
or
Curse— not both. It can learn
Cut
,
Strength
,
Rock Smash
, and
Rock Climb
for
HM
moves, which will help on your adventure. Torterra does have a major weakness to
Ice-type
attacks, so be wary of that. In any case, Turtwig does quite well at the Gyms for the most part and is a very good choice.
Chimchar, the Chimp Pokémon, has high speed and high attacking stats, but at the cost of having quite low defenses (these are usual for
Fire-type
Pokémon). It can use physical and special moves well. It evolves at Level 14 into
Monferno
, a
Fire
/
Fighting
-type Pokémon, and gains a ton of power, even immediately learning
Mach Punch
after evolving and learning one of the second strongest Fighting-type moves,
Close Combat
, at Level 36. At this level, Monferno will evolve into
Infernape
. If you make sure Chimchar evolves before or in the first Gym, you shouldn't have trouble with the Rock-type Pokémon. Chimchar and its evolutions focus primarily on offense and speed, having very high Attack, Special Attack and Speed. Its Defense and Special Defense are low, but it has the power to take out most Pokémon in the game with one or two hits before they even get a chance to strike, so it's not really that bad unless there is a type disadvantage. Some good moves Chimchar gets are
Flame Wheel
, Close Combat and
Flare Blitz
. Chimchar can also learn
Flamethrower
at Level 41 if you don't evolve it until then, but if you evolved it, Monferno and Infernape can still learn via TM35, which can be obtained before the sixth Gym.
Brick Break
,
Focus Blast
, and
Fire Blast
are some TM moves to consider, although it learns many, many more, and even learns
Rock Slide
,
Stone Edge
, Earthquake and
Dig
. It gets the HMs Cut, Strength (a good attacking option as well), Rock Smash, and Rock Climb. In comparison to the other two first partner Pokémon, Chimchar is probably the best if you're looking for an easier ride through the game. Also, if you don't choose Chimchar, you should know that
Ponyta
evolutionary line is this game's only other Fire-type Pokémon.
Piplup, the Penguin Pokémon, has high defenses and Special Attack. Its Attack and Speed aren't that great, unfortunately. It evolves into
Prinplup
at Lv.16. When it evolves further into
Empoleon
at Level 36, it gains the Steel type, making it a unique
Water
/
Steel
-type Pokémon. The addition of the Steel type will give it a wide variety of resistances, making it take very little damage from quite a few attacks. Pretty much, only
Electric-type
, Fighting-type, and Ground-type attacks are what you need to watch out for— nearly everything else is resisted. Unfortunately, this good typing comes at a high cost: a movepool that isn't the best. Basically, its best level up moves are
Metal Claw
,
Aqua Jet
,
Peck
, and
Drill Peck
. With Empoleon's sub-par Attack stat, it is better off using Special-based attacks such as
BubbleBeam
, which Prinplup learns at Level 24. If you are fine using TMs and HMs on Empoleon,
HM03
(
Surf
) and
TM91
(
Flash Cannon
) are both very powerful attacks for Empoleon to learn. Also, Empoleon does eventually get the second strongest Water-type attack
Hydro Pump
at Level 59, but it has low PP and accuracy. In comparison to the other two first partners, Piplup is probably the hardest to use. It will struggle with sub-par moves until you get the HM for
Surf
(right before the fifth Badge), but will then become much more useful. Teach it Flash Cannon as soon as you acquire that TM, and it will be very powerful. Don't think that Piplup is a bad choice— it's a great Pokémon and the extra effort of training one is well worth it.
All of the first partners are good choices and it is down to your personal preference to make a decision. In any case, it's time to move on.
First Battle
Battle the Level 2 Starly, and defeat it to give your new Pokémon 16 experience points. Suddenly, Lucas/Dawn returns and remarks that Rowan would be very angry if he/she forgot the briefcase. When Lucas/Dawn realizes that you have used the Pokémon from the briefcase, he/she takes the briefcase and hurries off.
On the way back
Getting the
Running Shoes
On the way back to Twinleaf Town, you meet Lucas/Dawn and
Professor Rowan
, who takes a look at the Pokémon you and Barry have and returns to his lab. Rowan's assistant mentions that you should stop by Rowan's lab and then hurries off.
After that, you will automatically return to your house in Twinleaf Town. You explain the situation that occurred at the lake, and Mom gives you a pair of
Running Shoes
and asks you to visit Professor Rowan in
Sandgem Town
.

Sandgem Town
Upon reaching Sandgem Town, Professor Rowan's assistant will stop you and have you go with him/her. You are then shown the
Pokémon Research Lab
, the largest building in town. As you are about to enter, Barry zooms out and says that Rowan isn't as intimidating as he first seemed, and then departs for
Jubilife City
. After entering the lab, Professor Rowan examines the Pokémon you chose at the lake and lets you keep it as a gift. You will then be given the option to give it a
nickname
. The professor formally introduces himself, and entrusts you with a
Pokédex
to record the data of all the Pokémon that are found throughout the
Sinnoh
region. Lucas/Dawn also says that he/she is on a Pokédex quest and mentions the first Pokémon that he/she used, which happens to be the one not chosen by you or your rival at the lake.
Upon leaving the lab, Lucas/Dawn will give you a tour and show you the
Pokémon Center
and
Poké Mart
. He/she then insists that you tell your mom that you are leaving on a journey and leaves to
Route 202
, where he/she won't let you pass until you complete your mission in Twinleaf Town.

Backtrack on Route 201 and head to your house. After you get some rest, your mother is happy to hear the news and will give you the
Journal
to keep a record of your day-to-day activities, and she tells you to make sure to come back to visit. Barry's mother then stops by and admits that Barry left so fast that he forgot the
Parcel
, but your mother suggests that you can delivery this to Barry personally. Barry's mom mentions that Barry should be in
Jubilife City
right now.
Leave Twinleaf and return to Sandgem Town. Head south to
Route 219
to pick up a bottle of
Antidote
, but you cannot explore the rest of this route until you can use
Surf
. Head north of Sandgem Town to reach Route 202.
