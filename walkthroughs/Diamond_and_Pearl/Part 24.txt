Back at Home -- Twinleaf Town
Congratulations! You have become the Champion and advanced to the After Game storyline.
You'll start in your room at home, in
Twinleaf Town
, just like the start of your game. (Every time you beat the Pokémon League, you'll start here again.)
Check your Trainer Card. You'll find that a star is added and the colour of your Card changed. Turn to your back and you'll find the record "Hall Of Fame Debut".
Check your Pokédex. You'll also find that you've seen all 150 Pokémon...... no,
the first 150
Pokémon in
Sinnoh Pokédex
, but only if you strictly followed this walkthrough and faced all Trainers. If you have completed, great job! However, there are a lot of Pokémon for you to see, not just only 150...... But anyway. You should tell this to
Professor Rowan
. So, get ready and head downstairs.
Your Mom will tell you that
Rival
Barry
has gone to the
Battle Zone
. The Battle Zone is the island northeast of the main part of Sinnoh Region. You can access there by taking a ship in
Snowpoint City
, but for now, you cannot do much. Head to
Sandgem Town
(where the Pokémon Research Lab is) first.
Sandgem Town
You'll see Prof. Rowan's aide Dawn/Lucas outside the Pokémon Research Lab. She/He will congratulate you. Head to the Pokémon Centre and boot up the PC. Access "Rowan's PC". If you've seen all of the first 150 Pokémon in Sinnoh, Prof. Rowan will tell you to come over to the Lab!
Pokémon Research Lab-- Upgrading Pokédex to National Pokédex
Talk to Prof. Rowan. He tells you that he has been waiting.
Professor Oak
then comes in. The 2 professors joke around. After that, Prof. Oak upgrades your Pokédex with National Mode!
Afterwards, Prof. Oak will say that
Pal Park
is now open and hurries off for a meeting.
Finally, Prof. Rowan will give you a
Poké Radar
for you to catch special Pokémon in grass.
I missed some Pokémon!
Check your Pokédex and hunt down the Pokémon that you haven't seen yet. There are some Pokémon that are easily omitted, especially 3 of them.
Unown
Go to
Solaceon Ruins
and enter a wild Pokémon battle. No
Trainers
use Unown and the only place to see it is Solaceon Ruins.
Riolu
If you don't have the patience to hatch the Riolu egg, didn't get the egg from
Riley
, or didn't even visit
Iron Island
, you'll have to see one in the basement of
Oreburgh Gate
. Surf west and you can fight
Veteran
Grant to see one. Refer to Section 13 for details.
Opposite
game mascot
You can see the picture of
Palkia
D
or
Dialga
P
in
Celestic Town
after catching your game mascot. Refer to Section 20 for details. If you have seen 149 Pokémon and this is the only one unseen, Dawn/Lucas will inform you that
Cynthia
's grandmother wants you to visit her.
Optional Pokémon:
Manaphy
Here is a special note about the optional Pokémon for completing the
Sinnoh Dex
.
Mythical Pokémon
Manaphy-- which is a member of the
Sea guardians
, is the last entry in
Sinnoh Dex
, numbered as #151. It is the
only optional Pokémon
for the completion of Sinnoh Dex, but all other 150 Pokémon are compulsory. What does it mean? If you somehow possess Manaphy, all 151 Pokémon included by the Sinnoh Dex must be seen before you can obtain the National Dex. If you have Manaphy, but have not seen any of the required 150 Pokémon, you will not obtain the National Mode upgrade.
You don't really need to freak out about missing this one. But if you really want to have Manaphy, a game that belongs to the Pokémon Ranger series is required. Complete a special mission through
Ranger Net
and transfer the Manaphy egg (which has a unique sprite as opposed to other eggs) to this game. Hatch the egg to obtain Manaphy.
Afterwards......
There are many more things for you to do:
Explore Battle Zone
Catch some new Pokémon
Pokémon Swarm
Poké Radar
Pokémon Mansion
Legendary Pokémon
Go to
Pal Park
Explore
Route 224
Collect
Diploma
You can now really explore Battle Zone, but you still have something to do in the main part of Sinnoh! Why wouldn't you finish these things first?
This walkthrough will start from swarming Pokémon.
Pokémon Swarm
Now that you got the National Pokedex,
Jubilife TV
will have a News Flash to tell you that there is a swarm (also known as mass outbreak) of Pokémon at somewhere in the region.
Dawn
/
Lucas
's sister will also tell you about the swarm. To find her, go to Dawn's/Lucas' house in
Sandgem Town
.
The outbreak will let you catch some previously unavailable Pokémon. The swarm lasts for a day and expires at midnight (12:00AM). The next day, another swarm of Pokémon will appear.
