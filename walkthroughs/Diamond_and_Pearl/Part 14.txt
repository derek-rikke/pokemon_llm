Jubilife City
Go to
Jubilife City
. Head west from
Jubilife TV
and the Pokétch Company (if you haven't got the new Pokétch Apps after getting your first, third and fifth Gym Badge, you can stop by to get those Apps), get through the gate, and you are on
Route 218
. If you have not taken the
Old Rod
, talk to the fisherman in the gate and answer "Yes" to get it.
Route 218
Route 218
You need to bring Pokémon with
Surf
.
You can visit this route near the start of the game, but you cannot go far. The route follows a short path over land before reaching a body of water with a small island in the middle. A pair of bridges take travellers partway across the water, but do not go all the way to the other side. With the ability to use
Surf
on the field, you can surf on the water and go on.
Travelling north from the central island yields a short journey to the far side of the stream where long grass grows. From here, a gateway leads to Canalave City. Surfing south will take you to the same landmass as the northern route, but a row of tall trees prevents further passage.
Honey
and two fishermen can be found here.

Enter the gate on the west. Dawn's/Lucas' father, who is one of
Professor Rowan
's assistants, will upgrade your Pokédex. He will then go back to the Lab. Check your Pokédex. You will find that you can check the gender differences or form differences of every seen Pokémon. Afterwards, go through the gate.

Canalave City.
You will find yourself in
Canalave City
after getting through the gate.
Here, you will find the

in one of the house.
The house at the northeast of Pokémon Center, the
Harbor Inn
, is locked, and the sign is too faded to read. Just ignore that house.
Make sure that you heal your Pokémon before stepping on the bridge!
A tough battle will be waiting for you.

Canalave City (West)
You will see the
Canalave Library
, Canalave Gym and Canalave Dock.
Canalave Library is a small library. There are many shelves of different books. There is a sign that informs people that eating and drinking are prohibited. People can be seen here reading about Pokémon and other books. The upper floors of the library have the same layout as the lower floors, except that most of the books on the bookshelves can be read. These books are very philosophical and go in-depth into the history and existence of the Pokémon world as known. These books are considered Sinnoh myths, that many people believe and study by. These books include, the Sinnoh Myth, which refers to Mesprit, the Sinnoh Region's Mythology, which explains why wild Pokémon appear in grass, the Sinnoh's Myth, which explains the existence of the lake guardians, the Veilstone's Myth, which tells a story about a young swordsman encountering Giratina, The Original Story, which explains the origin of the Pokémon world, A Horrific Myth, which tells a horrible tale about the lake guardians, and several other Sinnoh Folk Tales.
A local Sailor called Eldritch lives in a small house near Canalave Dock with his wife and young son. At Canalave Dock, Sailor Eldritch will take you to
Iron Island
.
You can challenge the Gym right now, but it is not recommended. Instead, go to Canalave Dock and board the ship to Iron Island. You can train your Pokémon there.
Make sure that you heal your Pokémon and buy enough items before boarding the ship to Iron Island.
It is also recommended that you bring five Pokémon or fewer, as you will see at the end of the mission.
Iron Island
Iron Island
Iron Island is an island off the northwestern coast of
Sinnoh
. It was once a prosperous ore mine, but was shut down after the ore reserves dried up. Since then, it was kept open as a training area and habitat for wild Pokémon.
There is no Pokémon Center on this island. However, you will be teaming up with someone quite soon.

When you go down the stairs, a Trainer named
Riley
will be waiting for you. He will team up with you and help you to go through this room. He has a Level 34
Lucario
. Like
Cheryl
and
Mira
, he will fully heal all of your Pokémon, as well as his Lucario, after each battle. Wild Pokémon battles will become
Double Battles
. This place provides a good training opportunity due to the fact that you get healed after every battle.

At the end, you will encounter two Galactic Grunts. Riley says that he needs to protect the island. Judging from his quote, "I don't want
you
bringing any trouble into my mine," he is probably the owner of Iron Island. He tells you that "this is a battle that we can't lose" and then challenges the grunts with you as his partner.

After defeating them, those grunts will leave. Riley than thanks you and asks you if you want to receive an egg as a token of friendship. If you say "No", he will ask you again. Say "Yes", and if you have a space in your party, he will give the egg to you. If you have a full party, then he will notice this after you say yes and say that he will wait for your return. Return with five Pokémon or fewer in your party later if you have a full party. The egg will hatch into Lucario's pre-evolution--
Riolu
, a
Fighting-type
Pokémon. It evolves into Lucario when leveled up in the
daytime
with maximum
happiness
.
Afterwards, use the elevator to go down, and then head into the next room.

.

Leader Byron in the Canalave Gym
The Canalave Gym is a four-story building made of fixed steel platforms, lifts, and moving metal platforms. You must ride the lifts and moving platforms in a certain order while battling other Trainers in the Gym to reach the top floor, on which Gym Leader
Byron
waits. There are two kinds of lifts: yellow lifts and red lifts. Yellow lifts operate between 2 floors. Red lifts can shoot from the bottom floor to the very top floor, and vice versa. Some platforms travel on wires between fixed floor areas.
This Gym specializes in
Steel-type
Pokémon, so bring
Fire-type
,
Fighting-type
, and
Ground-type
Pokémon along. Or you can bring Pokémon with moves of those three types. The Gym Trainers uses mostly
Onix
and its
evolved
form
Steelix
. Onix's evolutionary line is partially Ground-type. You can even find Trainers using
Skorupi
and
Azumarill
, which are unexpected. Therefore, bringing
Water-type
Pokémon and
Electric-type
,
Grass-type
or
Flying-type
Pokémon may help a bit.

Leader Byron uses three Pokémon. Due to the having Ability
Levitate
and being a
Psychic-type
Pokémon,
Bronzor
is not affected by Ground-type moves and only takes normal damage from Fighting-type moves, so Fire-type moves are your only choice.
Steelix
has
Ice Fang
, so avoid using Ground-type Pokémon on it. Its
DragonBreath
may surprise you and paralyze your Pokémon. Byron's strongest Pokémon is
Bastiodon
. It is very good defensively, but its Rock/Steel typing gives it two major weaknesses: 4× damage from both Fighting-type and Ground-type moves. Avoid using Fire-type Pokémon against Bastiodon. Hit Bastiodon hard with Fighting-type or Ground-type moves fast before it uses
Iron Defense
to boost its Defense stat.
After beating Byron, he will give you the Mine Badge and
TM91
(
Flash Cannon
). You can also use Strength on the field.
You don't need to go all the way back, though— there is a shortcut. Head to the moving platform east of Byron. Use all three of them (which almost form a square), and you will be at the west side of the top floor. Get to the lift, and you will be brought back to the bottom floor.
Afterwards......
When you leave the Gym, Rival Barry will tell you to go to Canalave Library. Now that you can use
Strength
, you have three choices:
Go to Canalave Library as Rival Barry says
Go to places that you can use Strength to collect items you couldn't get
Get through northern part of Mt. Coronet, Route 216-217, Lake Acuity, Snowpoint City and challenge Snowpoint Gym
If you want to follow the storyline, choose the first choice. If you want to get the 7th Badge now, choose the third choice. You will actually need to access
Lake Acuity
quite soon, so the third choice is not bad. Remember that there is a blizzard on
Route 217
, and be prepared for the worst situation. This walkthrough will cover the second choice first, then first choice, and finally the third choice.
However, if you don't have
HM04
(
Strength
), you must return to
Lost Tower
on
Route 209
(south of
Solaceon Town
) and get it first! Otherwise, you will not be able to proceed!
