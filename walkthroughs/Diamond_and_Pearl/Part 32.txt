Route 228
Back in Survival Area
Enter all of the houses, and you'll eventually find
Buck
and his grandfather. First, talk to Buck's grandfather and he'll tell you that the legendary Pokémon
Heatran
will be enraged if the
Magma Stone
is taken, and
Stark Mountain
will erupt! Next, talk to Buck. He finally knows that this is a serious matter and bolts off to put the Magma Stone back in its proper place.
Make sure that you talk to Buck and his grandfather, heal your Pokémon and buy at least 40
Dusk Balls
before proceeding back to the mountain! Be aware that you'll be facing a Level 70 Legendary Pokémon. You will also need the HMs
Surf
,
Rock Climb
,
Strength
, and
Rock Smash
.
Also, bring a Pokémon with
Cut
for the next step of the journey.
Back to Routes 226-227
Make sure that you talk to Buck and his grandfather, heal your Pokémon and buy at least 40 Dusk Balls before proceeding!
Go through Routes 226-227 again.
Back to Stark Mountain
It should be easier to go through the volcano this time because you know where you're going.
Entrance
Go through the room as you did previously.

Back Room
Back Room, with the furious Heatran
Buck is nowhere to be seen, but a Pokémon is standing in front of you. That is the legendary Pokémon Heatran. Heatran looks angry...... no, it looks furious. With Heatran enraged, the volcano will erupt for sure and destroy everything on
Battle Zone
. Seems like it is too late......
Wait, there is still one way to solve this mess and prevent the volcano from erupting. Guess what? You'll need to catch it. Another legendary Pokémon for you to catch!

When you're ready, talk to Heatran, and the battle will start. Heatran is a
Fire
/
Steel
-type Pokémon, and is at Level 70.
Ground-type
moves deal significant damage to it, so be careful if you're unleashing something like
Earthquake
or
Earth Power
. Start off with moves that causes
sleep
or
paralysis
(do not bother with
freeze
— it will instantly defrost with Fire-type moves. Heatran is also immune to being
burned
and
poisoned
). Follow up with a
Water
- or
Fighting
-type move. Then, keep on damaging with weaker attacks until its HP bar is red. After that, keep throwing
Dusk Balls
(as you're in a cave, these work best) until you successfully catch it. It does not know its
signature move
,
Magma Storm
, but watch out for
Lava Plume
, which can still hurt a lot!
Iron Head
can also potentially hit you hard. Do not hesitate to heal your Pokémon often.
Once you've caught Heatran, get yourself out of the volcano and continue to
Route 228
. From the T-junction of Routes 226 and 228, head east into the
gate
. Or, if you're not ready, Fly back to
Survival Area
first and heal up.
Route 228
Make sure that you heal your Pokémon and buy a lot of medicines before proceeding! You'll need to bring Pokémon with
Cut
,
Surf
and
Rock Smash
.

A colored background means that the Pokémon can be found in this location in the specified game. A white background with a colored letter means that the Pokémon cannot be found here.
This is a desert route. Similar to
Route 111
in
Hoenn
, a sandstorm will be raging, reducing the visibility and affecting battles (
Rock-type
,
Ground-type
, and
Steel-type
Pokémon are immune to sandstorms). Don't worry, though—you don't need a pair of
Go-Goggles
, unlike in
Pokémon Ruby, Sapphire
and
Emerald
. Instead, have your
Bicycle
ready again. Some places in this route can only be accessed by riding
up muddy slopes or across logs
on your bicycle. Make sure to have your Poketch App Dowsing Machine ready as well, because a lot of items are hidden in the sand.
You'll want to keep heading south to get to
Route 229
, but try to explore all over to get all of the items (a lot of which are rare or valuable) and fight all of the Trainers. Don't hesitate to heal if you need to.
