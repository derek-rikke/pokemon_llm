Once you exit

, you will come along a short path where there will be a bridge and a few
Fishermen
fishing. They will only battle if you talk to them. There is also large patch of tall grass, though there are no new Pokémon to catch here, as this is still
Route 205
. When you get through the grass, there are
Berries
to pick. There is also another
Honey Tree
and some
Honey
hidden behind it. You will reach
Eterna City
by going further east.

Welcome to
Eterna City
, the location of the second Gym. First off, it is recommended that you heal your Pokémon at the
Pokémon Center
. There, you can find a woman that will give you the
Friendship Checker
, a Pokétch upgrade that will analyze the happiness factor for your party Pokémon, which is useful when you are trying to evolve a Pokémon that evolves from high happiness or if you're trying to calculate the damage of the moves
Return
or
Frustration
.
There is also a building in the northwest corner owned by
Team Galactic
, but you won't be able to enter it without the move Cut. If you go east of Team Galactic's building, you will meet
Cynthia
. She will recognize you as working for
Professor Rowan
, and tell you she is looking into Pokémon mythology before giving you
HM01
(
Cut
). You can't use the HM until you've defeated
Gardenia
, the Gym Leader, though. There is plenty to do before you take the Gym challenge, so explore the city.
The large statue in the northeast corner of the city has a hidden
Draco Plate
, an item that increases the power of
Dragon-type
moves and changes
Arceus
to the Dragon type. Located next to the
Poké Mart
are the
Eterna Condominiums
. On the first floor is the
Name Rater
, who will let you change your Pokémon's nickname, as well as a boy called Norton, who will trade his
Chatot
for a
Buizel
. On the second floor, a woman will give you
TM67
(
Recycle
). The
Herb Shop
is located east of Team Galactic's building, where you can buy healing herbs which lower your Pokémon's happiness but are far cheaper than most other equivalent healing items. It might be a good idea to buy some
Revival Herbs
.
Rad Rickshaw's Cycle Shop
is located north of the Poké Mart. However, you won't be able to get the
Bicycle
right away as the owner has gone to deal with Team Galactic in their building, since they had kidnapped his
Clefairy
.
You can also explore a part of
Route 211
and
Mt. Coronet
.
Underground House and the Underground
The Underground House is next to the Pokémon Center. This house is where you can get the
Explorer Kit
that allows you to explore the
Underground
, a massive network of underground tunnels where you can set up a
Secret Base
, play with friends using DS wireless communications, and dig for
Evolution stones
,
Fossils
, and other valuable items. The
Skull Fossil
D
and
Armor Fossil
P
can be revived into the Pokémon
Cranidos
and
Shieldon
, respectively, at the museum in
Oreburgh City
. Other Fossils will become available much later in the game, after you receive the
National Pokédex
. Don't worry about it right now.
The Underground Man will give you missions to do underground, each with various rewards.
Route 211 (West)
You'll need to bring Pokémon with
Rock Smash
.
There are three Trainers to fight and some Pokémon for you to catch here, such as
Ponyta
,
Meditite
and
Chingling
. If you didn't choose
Chimchar
as your starter Pokémon, Ponyta evolutionary line will be your only 2
Fire-type
Pokémon you can use in the main storyline of this game.

After healing at the Pokémon Center, go to the Eterna Gym.
Eterna Gym
The Eterna Gym's layout.
Make sure that your Pokémon are fully healed before entering.
It is also recommended that you don't challenge the Gym unless your Pokémon are at about Level 20. Gardenia is a master of the
Grass-type
, so if you started with
Chimchar
this should be relatively easy. If not, try and raise a higher-leveled
Flying
or
Bug
-type Pokémon such as
Kricketune
or
Staravia
, or go east of Eterna to
Route 211
to find a
Ponyta
.
Once you enter the Gym, talk to Gardenia and she'll tell you that you have to take the Gym challenge before battling her, which consists of finding and battling four Trainers.
The first Trainer is located by the Gym Leader's area (north of the entrance). You can find her in the first branch of trees that is slightly to the left, then moving south a little bit. The second one can be found by making your way down the left-most corridor, to the southwestern area that has a dead-end near the two rocks. The third is hiding behind the three small trees near the entrance to the room. And lastly, the final Trainer is in the very northeastern-most corner, which is accessible by taking the first right from the entrance all the way to the end. After defeating all four of them, Gardenia will appear in the northern area of the room.

All of Gardenia's Pokémon know the attack
Grass Knot
, which does higher damage to
heavier
Pokémon. This shouldn't be a huge worry at this stage in the game. Gardenia's
Cherubi
's
Leech Seed
can make things inconvenient for you really fast, so be sure to knock out this Pokémon quickly.
Safeguard
will protect Gardenia's team from
status conditions
for five turns.
Turtwig
isn't a huge threat either, although its high defensive stats can prove to be irritating. Get it knocked out quickly, since it can raise its Defense with
Withdraw
and protect the team from physical attacks for five turns with
Reflect
. Gardenia's last Pokémon,
Roserade
, is a huge threat with its unbelievable Special Attack stat. Its attack
Magical Leaf
will never miss and is not something you want one of your Pokémon to be hit by.
Stun Spore
will cause
paralysis
if it hits, and
Poison Sting
may
poison
your Pokémon. The best strategy in this Gym is to keep attacking with the most powerful moves at your disposal, not allowing Gardenia's team to set up strategies that will make the battle harder for you.
Once you beat Gardenia, you will receive the
Forest Badge
. This Badge will cause all Pokémon up to Level 30 to now obey you without question, and will allow you to use
Cut
out of battle. You will also get get
TM86
(
Grass Knot
).
Now that you can use Cut, it's time to enter the Team Galactic building to save
Rad Rickshaw
! Before that, you can also check out some previously inaccessible areas to find some items.
Now that you can use
Cut
......
You can get some items you previously couldn't get.
Eterna City
You can get the TM for Thief behind the Team Galactic building, which can allow you to steal items from wild Pokémon and trainers if you aren't holding an item.

Upon entering, the Old Chateau appears to be old and abandoned. The first room encountered is the foyer, which has two flights of stairs both leading to the first floor. Between the foyer's staircases is a door to the dining hall, where a long wooden tables dominates the room. The kitchen area can be accessed on the left side of the table. Just outside of the room stands a strange statue with an ominous aura; the statue "appears as if it is glaring".
On the first floor, left and right of the main room extends a library, where old books are cramped into bookshelves.
There are also 4 bedrooms that can be accessed to by traveling further up the first floor. In one of the rooms there is a television that is on and displaying a plain, white, flickering screen. There is also a portrait in another room; glowing red eyes appear on it that will stare at people when their back is turned and will disappear when faced.
The butler who appears in the dining hall
The little girl who appears in the bedroom
Sometimes, what seem to be the ghosts of a little girl and a butler appear in a bedroom on the first floor and in the dining hall, respectively. The butler appears to be sitting at the other side of the table in the dining room. The player walks forward and he starts to "walk" to the left side of the room, leaving the game window. He never appears on the other side. Unlike the little girl, the butler does not use a walking motion. He instead appears to just "float" off the ground. The little girl appears when the player enters the room next to the bedroom where the ghost "is". She appears to "walk" through the door and is never seen on the other side.
These two characters cannot be interacted with, which—accompanied with Gardenia's reports that the Chateau is haunted—lends to the theory that they are both ghosts.
Additionally, the picture in the room, in which the ghost of the little girl is visible, the eyes may begin to "blink" and/or follow the player.
This is the first place to find wild

Make sure that you heal your Pokémon before proceeding! You'll need to bring Pokémon with

Once you reach this floor, you will see the Team Galactic
Commander Jupiter
along with Rad Rickshaw and his stolen Clefairy along with a
Buneary
. Talk to her and she will see that you have come to rescue the Pokémon and immediately challenges you to a battle. If you have a
Geodude
make sure it knows
Magnitude
since her
Skuntank
is only weak to
Ground-type
attacks. A
Shellos
with the move
Mud Bomb
is also good. Otherwise without them the battle will be more difficult especially since Skuntank knows
SmokeScreen
to reduce your Pokémon's accuracy.
When you defeat her, Jupiter says that she doesn't care because she finished analyzing the statue and that
Commander Mars
had collected enough energy from
Valley Windworks
. Before leaving she advises you to stay out of their affairs, by pointing out that her boss is researching mythological Pokémon to take over Sinnoh with. After she leaves talk to Rad Rickshaw and he says they were after Clefairy because of the myth that Clefairy originated from space, though their logic had confused him.
After Rad leaves, head out of the Galactic Building and head to his Bicycle shop. Rad will award you with the latest
Bicycle
. Unlike the previous Bicycles, this one has the ability to switch to fourth gear for faster speed and the ability to climb slopes, or third gear for easier handling and jumping not as far when jumping off dirt mounds which is useful in some cases. The gears can be changed by pressing B button. Once you are ready, head to the south exit towards
Route 206
