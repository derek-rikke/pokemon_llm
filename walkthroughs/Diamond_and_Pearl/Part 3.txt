While there is not much that can be done here until you obtain the
Bicycle
, you can find a
Machop
here to help in the upcoming
Gym
match, especially if you started with
Chimchar
. You can also pick up a couple of
Poké Balls
in the grass.
Be aware that there are some Berries planted, but you cannot reach them until you get the second Badge. If you don't want the Berry plants to die, do not go too far north or try getting the items.

In order to battle the

. He can be found in the basement. After he shows you
Rock Smash
, he returns to the
Gym
and will wait there for you to challenge him. There are two
Workers
for you to battle here and a few items to pick up. You can also find wild
Onix
here, which can be a good addition to your team if you can later evolve it into
Steelix
through
trade
, but is otherwise probably not worth the effort.

Oreburgh Gym
Heal your Pokémon before entering the Gym.
The Gym battle can be tough. It is recommended that you train your Pokémon until they're at Level 13 or more.
It's now time for your first
Gym
battle. The
Oreburgh Gym
is pretty straightforward and has no puzzles, though it is possible to take the raised path and avoid the two Trainers present. However, the Trainers are pretty easy to beat, and it's always good to gain some extra
money
and
experience
.

Roark leads with a Level 12
Geodude
which is easily knocked out by any move that is
super effective
against
Rock
(e.g.
Water
,
Grass
, or
Fighting
; you should definitely have a move of one of those types). If you don't bring it down, it can use
Stealth Rock
, which damages Pokémon you
switch into
battle. His Level 12
Onix
has high
Defense
, so it may take two or three hits unless you are using a Water or Grass-type move, or a
non-resisted
Special-based attack
. Onix has the same moves as Geodude, plus
Screech
, which makes your
Defense
plummet. Level 14
Cranidos
can be a huge problem if you don't outspeed and knock it out very soon. It has an extremely high
Attack
, plus
Headbutt
for massive damage and
Leer
to drop your
Defense
, making its attacks more damaging.
Pursuit
is a solid move that can hurt a lot if you
switch out
your Pokémon. However, Cranidos is very fragile, so one or two super-effective hits will bring it down before it can completely destroy your team. Moves like
Mega Drain
,
Mach Punch
,
Bubble
, and
Metal Claw
work well.
After the battle, Roark gives you the
Coal Badge
and
TM76
(
Stealth Rock
). You can now use
Rock Smash
outside of battle, and
Poké Marts
will start carrying more items, such as
Super Potions
,
Repels
, and
Escape Ropes
. Now head back to
Oreburgh Gate
, where you meet
Barry
. He tells you to go back to
Jubilife City
and go north to
Eterna City
.
Oreburgh Gate (Basement)
Oreburgh Gate Basement
You'll need to bring Pokémon with
Rock Smash
.
Now that you have the ability to use
Rock Smash
, you can destroy the rocks to reach
Oreburgh Gate
's basement. This is the first place in the game to find a
Psyduck
, as well as
TM70
(
Flash
). This former
HM
can be used later in the game to light up dark caves, and extra copies can be bought in the
Veilstone Department Store
.
Later...
Come back after receiving the
Bicycle
to hop over the dirt mounds to receive
TM31
(
Brick Break
). Then after beating the
Hearthome Gym
and
Canalave Gym
, you can use
Surf
and
Strength
to find the
Earth Plate
and
TM01
(
Focus Punch
).

After the battle, the Grunts run off. Professor Rowan explains that they are part of
Team Galactic
, a
villainous group
that seeks power from Pokémon
evolution
for some nefarious purpose. Rowan explains that Pokémon release some type of energy when they evolve, but he believes it is a "mystic power" beyond human control. After he and Lucas/Dawn leave, a man from
Jubilife TV
gives you a
Fashion Case
, which can hold
accessories
and
backdrops
, and tells you that the TV station is now open to visitors.
Additionally, the Global Trade Station will also be open. You can also collect a new application program for your
Pokétch
.

On the first floor, you can enter The Pokémon Lottery Corner. It is located on the ground floor of the Jubilife TV building, where it is conducted by a receptionist named
Felicity
. The winning ID number changes daily, and the game looks for matches by examining the IDs of all Pokémon in the player's party and in all PC boxes (but not Pokémon in the
Day Care
). You can only check for one match a day.

On the third floor, you can go inside the

Easy chat system
, you can unlock
Mystery Gift
. You can answer more questions to get some PC Box wallpapers. The phrase for a given wallpaper depends on the player's game,
Trainer ID
, and game language.
Online generators
have been created to provide the required phrases for any game.
Global Trade Station (GTS)
Outside of the GTS
Inside the GTS
The Global Trade Station (GTS for short) is the worldwide network over which you can
trade
Pokémon via the
Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection
. Now that you have
Coal Badge
, the GTS is also open. There is a large globe called the
Geonet
, which you can indicate their location, and on which small dots representing players you have traded with will appear. When you first logs on to Geonet, you will be asked where you live in. Talk to the woman at the counter. She will direct you into a room in which you can either put up a Pokémon to be traded or trade a Pokémon you own for one that has been put up.
Pokémon searches, after being confined to one species that has been seen by the player, can be further narrowed down to
level
,
gender
and the country where the person is trading it from is. By level, players can search for and request Pokémon Lv.9 or below, Lv.10 or above, Lv.20 or above and so on until Lv.100, or they can search for Pokémon of any level. Gender is similar, with the player being able to search for male, female or either gender of the selected Pokémon; searching for genderless species automatically sets the gender to 'either'.
Pokémon offerings are similarly governed, as the requested Pokémon in return cannot be any Pokémon that the player has not seen. Pokémon that are offered cannot be bargained, as the player has to choose one Pokémon he or she wants for it, instead of having a more flexible list. Like normal trades, a Pokémon can also hold an item when being offered or traded. Pokémon that evolve after a trade will do so in the same manner they would after a normal trade. The GTS also allows individuals to trade between two different games without having two Nintendo DS systems. It is recommended to check up on a deposited Pokémon every so often, as the Pokémon may flee if it is kept in the GTS for an extended period of time.
Pokétch Company
Go to the
Pokétch Company
and talk to the owner. He will give you a new application program (abbreviated as App, just like iPhone and Android Apps in your real life) Memo Pad for your
Pokétch
. Talk to him again and he will say that the next App will be ready when you have 3 Gym
Badges
.

Parlyz Heal
and battle the trainers here. Now that you can use
