Inside Fuego Ironworks
There are many Trainers inside. You will also see something familiar if you have played Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen. Yes, these are the
spinners
again. Step on it, and you will spin in circles and travel in the direction that the arrow of the spinner points to. For example, if you step on a spinner with an arrow on it that points to the left, you will spin to the left and keep going until you hit something or another spinner.
There are a few Trainers for you to fight. Fight them, collect the items and use the spinners to go around. Eventually you will reach the boiler and Mr. Fuego. He will give you a Fire Stone. Afterwards, collect
TM35
(
Flamethrower
), and leave Fuego Ironworks.
There is an one-way exit east of Fuego Ironworks, which leads you back to Route 205. Jump down the two ledges, and you will find yourself near the entrance of
Eterna Forest
and the healing house.

Route 220
Route 220
This route connects Route 219 and Route 221. The route is separated into 3 paths. On the northern shortcut, there is only one Trainer:
Swimmer
Katelyn. Also, this path is the shortest out of all 3, so this is the easiest way of crossing the route. The middle path has the most Trainers. The southern path contains several items for the player to collect, but when you arrive at
Route 221
, you will find that this bypass actually leads to a dead end with a Trainer.

Surf east from any of the three paths to reach Route 221.
Route 221
Route 221
This route leads to
Pal Park
, which has not opened yet. If you surf to this route from the southern path of Route 220, you will end up in a dead end with
Swimmer
Vanessa. If you want to proceed further, surf to this route from the northern or middle path of Route 220.
You will have two possible paths to Pal Park after you stop Surfing. On the northern path, there is a
Honey Tree
, no grass, and only one Trainer:
Collector
Ivan. This is the easiest path to Pal Park.
North of this path, a small maze of grass and trees leads to a house. An elderly man in the house will tell you a random number between 1 and 100 once a day. He will give you a
Black Belt
,
Expert Belt
, or
Focus Sash
if shown a Pokémon of the
level
he called out. The first time you show him the correct level Pokémon, he will give a Black Belt as a reward; the second time, he gives an Expert Belt; the third time, a Focus Sash. The pattern then repeats.
On the southern path, there is more grass, more Trainers, and a Berry patch.
