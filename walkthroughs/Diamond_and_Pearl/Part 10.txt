Route 214
Once you reach Route 214, other than a Berry patch you'll find two separate paths, one to the east end and one of the west. The one on the west follows a mountain path where you won't have to face as many Trainers when compared to the east path. At the start of the western path you'll notice the door that leads you to
Maniac Tunnel
, which you can travel in if you want. Also if you have
Rock Smash
you can use it to clear away the rocks to avoid going through the tall grass on this end. Eventually it will to a patch of grass where you can find a
Max Potion
and a Honey Tree and then you can head south.
For the eastern path of this route, while you have to face more Trainers, no HM moves are needed for this section. Once you defeat Psychic Mitchell, head to the grass pattern west of him and touch the non-grass area of the grass pattern to find a hidden
Heart Scale
. If you continue heading down the eastern path you'll notice two trees missing from the pattern. They actually lead to the
Sendoff Spring
, which you can't get to until you defeat the Elite Four. Before leaving this route head slightly north above the Honey Tree and the Trainer Collector Douglas to find the
Big Root
, which enhances the amount of HP received from absorption-related techniques.
The wild Pokémon encountered here are at above Level 20, and with the Trainers scattered on this route, this is a decent training place if you couldn't beat the Veilstone Gym.

Ruin Maniac Cave / Maniac Tunnel
Maniac Tunnel with 0-9 Unown
Maniac Tunnel with 26-28 Unown
The
Maniac Tunnel
connects with the top floor of the
Solaceon Ruins
. While initially starting out small and called as Ruin Maniac Cave, the
Ruin Maniac
will expand the tunnel when you collect different types of
Unown
at the Solaceon Ruins.
Once all 26 have been caught, then the tunnel will be completed, the cave will be renamed as Maniac Tunnel and you can collect the
?
and
!
Unown to complete your collection.
The only item in this cave
TM28
(
Dig
) is located by the entrance. Additionally expanding the tunnel will help affect the encounter rate, particularly for finding
Hippopotas
at an easier ratio, as this is the only location to find one.

Hotel Grand Lake
Traveling south you'll reach
Hotel Grand Lake
which cuts between the Valor Lakefront and
Route 213
. The way to
Route 222
is blocked off by a man, making this Route impassable. This route leads to
Sunyshore City
and there is a blackout apparently. This place also has a house belonging to a game creator who will give the
Diploma
. Near the southern exit to the rest of Route 213 is the
Suite Key
, which is almost impossible to find with the
Dowsing Machine
due to its small size. You can find it by facing south and standing one step down from the stairs that are near the southern exit. If you take it to the northern corner and give it to the woman who is locked out of her house, she'll unlock the building and give you a
Lava Cookie
for your reward.
The building in the south is the reception area which leads to Route 213, and though the receptionist can't let you book a room due to the Hotel Grand Lake being full, he will heal your Pokémon. The House left of the reception building has a clown that will give you
TM92
(
Trick Room
).

Once leaving the Hotel Grand Lake, it is a simple path that will take you to

TM40
(
Aerial Ace
). The only house of this route belongs to
Dr. Footstep
who analyzes the Pokémon at the front of your team by their Happiness level with you and will give that Pokémon a
Footprint Ribbon
if the Happiness level is very high. Right around the west exit to Pastoria is another Berry patch.

Also the house north of the

has a kid that will give you a

in your party. Just remember that Burmy will change form if it fights in an area accustomed to that cloak. If you need to know where to fight to obtain one, the Plant cloak is the standard cloak for fighting on the grass, while the Caves or
Solaceon Ruins
are the best place for one to transform into the Sandy cloak, and the
Lost Tower
is the only place to obtain the Trash cloak.
