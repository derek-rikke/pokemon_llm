Now that you have the
Bicycle
you can head past the
gate
and onto Cycling Road which is part of
Route 206
. Until you encounter Lucas/Dawn on
Route 207
you will be unable to return to
Route 205
. Before leaving the Eterna City gate talk to the guy with blue hair and white coat and glass and learn he is
Rowan
's assistant and Lucas/Dawns father who will give you an
Exp. Share
which is a gift from the Professor if you've seen enough Pokémon. Once you are ready head down Cycling Road, battling as many Trainers as you wish. Since these Trainers have
Electric
,
Flying
, and
Fire-type
Pokémon, having a
Geodude
with you will make it easy.

Once you reach the southern gate you can step onto the rest of Route 206 where here you will find a Berry patch as will as a small tree that can be Cut which is located on the right side of the gate. Past the tree is a grassy area and you can find some wild Pokémon along with some items, another Trainer, and another Berry patch. This is the first place where you can find a wild
Bronzor
that occasionally has a
Metal Coat
that you can take for either powering up
Steel-type
moves or evolving
Onix
into
Steelix
.

Also on this route is the entrance to
Wayward Cave
which is along the grassy area that also has a hidden entrance which is located underneath the bridge that cannot be seen. This leads to a hidden area of the cave. While you can explore the main cave area there is nothing important for now unless if you wish to train your team or have a higher chance to catch a Bronzor. You can come back later after you've beaten the
Canalave Gym
to explore the hidden area for some good prizes. When ready head south to reach
Route 207
.
Wayward Cave (Main part)
Make sure that you have Pokémon with
Flash
and
Rock Smash
before heading into the cave.
The cave is very dark and
Flash
must be used to light up the cave. You can teach
TM70
(
Flash
) to a Pokémon right after you got the TM in the basement of
Oreburgh Gate
because Flash is no longer a HM, thus no Badges are required to use it on the field.

Main part of Wayward Cave
A girl called
Mira
, who has a level 18 Kadabra, was lost in the cave. Follow the path that
has no Trainers
(use
Rock Smash
along the way if you need), and you will find her in the northeast dead end. It is highly recommended that you
do not fight any Trainers
until you find Mira, because you will team up with her (like teaming up with
Cheryl
in
Eterna Forest
) afterwards and fight with Trainers in Multi Battles, which is a lot easier. Note that the wild battles will be Double Battles again, so catch the Pokémon you need before teaming up. Mira will also heal your Pokémon after every battle, similar to Cheryl.

The minute you step on this route you'll encounter Lucas/Dawn who ask if your journey is going well before having you guess the gift he/she has in his/her hand. Once you make your choice he/she will give you the
Vs. Seeker
which you can use to rechallenge any Trainer on the overfield. Lucas/Dawn will also give you the
Dowsing Machine
which is an upgrade for the Pokétch allowing you to detect any hidden item around you that gives off a bleep that tells you the distance between you and the item in the same fashion as the
Itemfinder
.

You can now access the Berry patch that you couldn't get to earlier as long as it hasn't gone away completely and you can use the Bicycle to go up and down the Dirt path allowing you easy access to
Oreburgh City
. If you have a
Skull Fossil
D
or
Armor Fossil
P
that was dug up from the
Underground
, it is recommended to head to the
Oreburgh Museum
to get them reanimated and receiver either a
Cranidos
D
or
Shieldon
P
. Anyway all you need to do here is defeat the enemy Trainers and head into the cave in the east which is the southern part of
Mt. Coronet
.
Now that you have a
Bicycle
......
You can go back to the basement of Oreburgh Gate for more items.
Oreburgh Gate
(Basement)
Use the Bicycle and ride on the ramps. You will then jump for the distance of 1 to 2 steps. The distance you jump depends on which gear you use, third or fourth. Shift to fourth gear to jump farther. You can get

Brick Break
).

This part will play an important role later in the game, but you will need to get
Surf
and
Rock Climb
first. For now, head for the stairs that are near the entrance. Here you'll have your first encounter with
a mysterious man
. He'll explain the myth that Mt. Coronet is where the Sinnoh region began. He'll also mention that because of human weakness the world had become filled with strife. After the man's speech there is nothing else you can do for now other than leave through the east exit, though
Rock Smash
can help make it easier so you won't have to walk as far and encounter as many Pokémon.

Once out of the cave all you have to do is head east to
Hearthome City
. The Trainers here mainly use Pokémon that are weak to
Flying
,
Fighting
,
Water
, and
Grass-type
attacks, so having a
Zubat
,
Roselia
, along with a
Machop
or
Monferno
will make the encounters much simpler. There are more trainers and items on this route, but you'll need
HMs
to gain access. Come back when you can use
Surf
,
Rock Climb
and

.

Once you head down the stairs from the mountain area to the grassy area, talk to the Black Belt near the Honey Tree to receive the

Hallowed Tower
on
Route 209
. Also in this area is the Berry Master's house. He'll give you a Berry once a day that is different from the ones handed out in Floaroma Town. His wife will also sell Mulch. Talking to his daughter will net you the
Berry Searcher
