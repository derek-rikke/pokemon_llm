When you first reach
Route 202
,
Professor Rowan
's assistant (
Lucas
/
Dawn
) will give a demonstration on how to catch Pokémon by catching a wild
Bidoof
. The assistant then gives you five
Poké Balls
. The Pokémon that Lucas/Dawn has is the
first partner Pokémon
that neither you nor
Barry
choose earlier. Before departing, Lucas/Dawn will mention that it is easier to capture a
wild Pokémon
if you lower the Pokémon's
Hit Points
more, and even easier if you inflict a
status condition
. Now that you can capture Pokémon, you can also
trade
between games through the
Union Room
.

Now that you can now use Poké Balls, it is recommended that you start catching a few Pokémon, such as
Starly
or
Shinx
. You will be facing
Barry
soon and his first partner Pokémon will be at the point where it will have a move of its own type in its arsenal, so your first partner Pokémon may need the extra backup.
Then you are off, having some of your first battles in the game. This is the first route where you can
battle
Trainers
. There are three Trainers here, none of which have a Pokémon stronger than
level
5.

Catching
Bidoof
and
evolving
it into a
Bibarel
(a
Normal
/
Water
-type Pokémon) is probably the best
HM mule
in the game because it can learn most of the
HMs
in the game.
Shinx
is a good pickup as a solid choice that evolves into
Luxio
and then
Luxray
. Shinx helps against
Water-type
and
Flying-type
Pokémon if you picked
Turtwig
or
Chimchar
, and helps
Piplup
out as well, but Shinx's evolutionary line focuses on
Attack
instead of
Special Attack
, so
Special-based moves
such as
Discharge
that it learns quite late and
Thunderbolt
will not deal much damage. Shinx and its evolutions can learn some
Physical-based
Electric-type
moves such as
Spark
and
Thunder Fang
, as well as two
Dark-type
moves,
Bite
and
Crunch
. These moves don't come early, though.
Kricketot
is hard to use even when it evolves into
Kricketune
.
Starly
is one of the best
Flying-type
Pokémon in the game, especially when it evolves into
Staravia
and then
Staraptor
, getting
Close Combat
and
Brave Bird
, plus being able to learn
Fly
and having very high
Attack
.

Continue on to
Jubilife City
, where
Lucas
/
Dawn
is waiting to tell you that your rival
Barry
is at the
Trainers' School
. Until you complete your missions here you cannot go east to
Route 203
. However, you can go north to
Route 204
to face more wild Pokémon and catch a
Budew
, which can help a little with your first
Gym
match, especially if you chose
Chimchar
.
Trainers' School
The building west of the
Pokémon Center
is the
Trainers' School
. Here, you meet Barry and give him the
Parcel
, which contains two
Town Maps
. Barry gives you one of them then leaves for
Oreburgh City
. There are two
Pokémon Trainers
that can be fought here, in the northeast corner of the school. After you beat them, you will receive a
TM10
(
Hidden Power
).

Pokétch Company
The
Pokétch Company
makes a new appliance called the Pokémon Watch, or
Pokétch
for short. After you receive the
Town Map
, the owner of the company, who is in the center of town, will approach you. He tells you to bring him three
Coupons
from the
clowns
around the city, and he will give you a Pokétch. The clowns ask simple yes/no-questions about Pokémon (and the answer is always "Yes"). When you get the question correct, you receive the Coupon. After you get all three Coupons, return to the man to receive the Pokétch. You can get the three Coupons in any order because you can talk to the clowns in any order you like.
The Pokétch building is the northwest corner of the city. If you return after you receive an odd-numbered Badge (i.e., the
Coal Badge
,
Cobble Badge
,
Relic Badge
, and
Icicle Badge
), you can talk to the owner inside the building to receive a new
application (Apps)
for your Pokétch. Out of those you can receive from him, the
Marking Map
is one of the most useful apps because it can be used to track
Roaming Pokémon
.
Later...
Global Trade Station
The building in the south western area is the
Global Trade Station
, where you can connect with other players worldwide. However, to enter the building,
Coal Badge
is required.
Jubilife TV
The building that is west of the northern exit to
Route 204
is the
Jubilife TV
station. For now, a
Clown
of the
Pokétch Company
Campaign blocks the entrance. You may enter after receiving the Coal Badge and the
Fashion Case
. Refer to
Section 3
for more information.
Additional Items
Inside the building west of Jubilife City that leads to
Route 218
, you can receive the
Old Rod
from a
Fisherman
, who also offers to teach you
how to fish
. You can't do anything on Route 218 but fish until you get
Surf
, but you can catch a
Magikarp
here with your Old Rod. This is a useful Pokémon if you have enough patience, because while Magikarp is the weakest Pokémon ever, it evolves into the brutally powerful
Gyarados
, which is a great addition to a team and can learn
Surf
,
Waterfall
,
Strength
, and
Rock Smash
.
Back in Jubilife City, the apartment east of the TV station has a blond-haired girl on the first floor that will give you a
Quick Claw
.

and catch some more Pokémon first.

Route 204
Here, you can catch some Pokémon and battle some Trainers, but you can't continue through the
Ravaged Path
until you get
Rock Smash
and the Coal Badge. (See
Section 3 of this walkthrough
.)
Budew
is a
Grass
/
Poison
-type Pokémon and the newly added pre-evolution of Roselia. It evolves into
Roselia
if leveled up during the day when its
friendship
is high, and will evolve again into the new final form
Roserade
when a
Shiny Stone
is used. Roselia evolutionary line has very high
Special Attack
and can learn the whole line of
Absorb
. Budew starts of with Absorb, picks up
Mega Drain
and eventually
Giga Drain
if evolved. Be sure to evolve it because Budew doesn't learn any good moves after picking up Mega Drain, unless it evolves. Try to let Budew evolve at or before Level 19 because that's when Roselia learns
Magical Leaf
. Afterwards, Roselia can learn
Petal Dance
. When Roselia evolves into Roserade, it doesn't learn any more moves, but its Special Attack will skyrocket. Roselia's evolutionary line can also learn
SolarBeam
and
Sludge Bomb
(a
Poison-type
move that has high base power and may poison the opponent), through
TMs
, making use of their high Sp. Atk.
You can encounter Zubat at night, or if you head into Ravaged Path.

Ravaged Path
You cannot proceed any further because of the rugged rocks. There are more Pokémon for you to catch: Zubat and Geodude. You should be familiar with them.
Zubat
is a
Poison
/
Flying
-type Pokémon. Zubat will evolve into
Golbat
starting at Level 22, then into
Crobat
when Golbat has high friendship. Zubat starts off with only
Leech Life
and is stuck with just that until it gets
Bite
and
Wing Attack
. Golbat will pick up
Mean Look
and
Poison Fang
(a Poison-type move that may inflict bad poison). Crobat has the same moveset as Golbat, except that it can relearn
Cross Poison
(a Poison-type move that has a high critical hit ratio) and learn
Fly
through the
HM
. Zubat will struggle a lot early on, but it will be more useful when it evolves into Golbat. You should know that Zubat evolutionary line has high Speed. When Golbat evolves again into Crobat, it be able to will outspeed most of the Pokémon you'll fight.
Geodude
is a
Rock
/
Ground
-type Pokémon. Geodude will evolve into
Graveler
starting at Level 25, then into
Golem
when traded. Geodude evolutionary line has high Attack and very high Defense, but low Special Attack and Special Defense. It is also very slow unless
Rock Polish
is used to boost its Speed. It can learn good Rock-type and Ground-type moves, such as
Stone Edge
and
Earthquake
by leveling up, as well as
Rock Slide
through
TM80
. It can also launch suicide attacks with
Selfdestruct
and
Explosion
. However, it has two major weaknesses: Water-type and Grass-type attacks are its nightmares.

1st Rival Battle
Make sure that you heal your Pokémon before proceeding, because you will have a tough fight very soon.
It is also recommended that you do not proceed unless your Pokémon are trained to Level 7 or above.
Now head east towards
Route 203
, where
your rival
will meet you and challenge you to a battle.

The only new find is
Abra
, which is a
Psychic-type
Pokémon. Abra will struggle a lot at first (even more troublesome than Zubat) due to knowing only
Teleport
. It is not even an attacking move— this move is used for escaping from battle. However, Abra will be powerful if you evolve it into
Kadabra
starting from Level 16, or even into
Alakazam
by
trading it
. Kadabra and Alakazam are able to pick up
Psychic
,
Future Sight
by leveling up and
Dream Eater
through TM. Abra evolutionary line has high Special Atk and Speed, but low Defense. Abra is difficult to catch because it will always use
Teleport
unless you use
Taunt
, which
Chimchar
will learn at level 9 (be careful that Abra will
Struggle
then). If you are unable or too impatient to catch Abra, a woman in
Oreburgh City
will trade you one for a
Machop
.
To avoid wild Pokémon, you can use the
Repel
found on the north bank of the pond. In the future, you will be able to buy Repels from
Poké Marts
.

Coal Badge
. Then fight the two Trainers inside the cave. There is nothing to do here until except fight the two Trainers and catch a
Geodude
or
Zubat
until you have your first Badge. Head east to

from different people around town. One of these, a

Old Amber
.
Oreburgh Pokémon Center
Though all
Pokémon Centers
have a
Wi-Fi Club
in their basements, Oreburgh's is the first one you can access. An attendant named
Teala
will give you a
Pal Pad
and explain how it works the first time you enter. You can now battle and
trade
with other players using their
Friend Code
. Additionally, a
Psychic
on the ground floor will ask you which kind of Trainer you want to be, presenting you with four options to choose from. This becomes your
Trainer class
while you are in a
Union Room
, and is otherwise assigned randomly.
Now head north to
Route 207
to catch a
Machop
, or just continue south to the
