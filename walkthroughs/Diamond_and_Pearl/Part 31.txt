Before proceeding......
Check the list in this section to make sure you're fully prepared. Another long journey is up ahead— You'll have to go through two somewhat long routes, as well as a massive volcano. There will be many Trainers for you to fight. A Trainer will team up with you in the same way as
Cheryl
,
Mira
,
Riley
and
Marley
, but you'd better not let your guard down because most of the wild Pokémon are at a high level, and there are a lot of Trainers.
Make sure that you have done the following things before going on:
Buy about 30 bottles for each kind of healing items (except Super Potion).
To save money, you might want to stock up on
Drinks
(Fresh Water, Soda Pop, Lemonade and Moomoo Milk) instead of Super Potions.
Have your leading Pokémon
hold the
Amulet Coin
or
Luck Incense
to gain double prize after Trainer battles, especially if you're running out of money.
Be aware that you'll face a legendary Pokémon quite soon. You will need the money to purchase a certain kind of Poke Balls.
Bring Pokémon with the following HMs:
Surf
Strength
Rock Smash
Rock Climb
Heal your Pokémon
before proceeding.

Continue north from the grass. Soon, you'll notice volcanic ash falling from the sky.
Stark Mountain
isn't too far ahead! Keep in mind that you want to go north and uphill, and it shouldn't be too much of a challenge. Also, you'll need to use your highest
Bicycle
gear to jump ramps to get over rocks, but be careful not to jump off the ledges. On the way, you'll see
Rival
Barry
and
Crasher Wake
having a conversation. You'll also see
Buck
again. At the top of the hill is the entrance to the volcano-- Stark Mountain!

Navigating through the volcano entrance room is fairly straightforward— the main puzzle is using Strength to push boulders up and down stairs. You'll want to keep going north. In front of the entrance to the next room, you'll find Barry, complaining about how he was defeated by
Buck
. He won't battle you, though, so continue deeper into the mountain.

A colored background means that the Pokémon can be found in this location in the specified game. A white background with a colored letter means that the Pokémon cannot be found here.
When you enter the large main cavern, you'll find your point of view zoomed out. This makes it easier to see where you are in this massive cavern.
Quickly, you'll find Buck again. He asks you to team up with him to find the
Magma Stone
, although he thinks you're "pretty wimpy". You'll be leading the way through the cave. While he's with you, you can't use
Rock Climb
to get all of the items, so don't even bother right now. However, he'll heal your Pokémon after every battle, just like
the other Trainers you teamed up with before
.
To get through the cave: First, head east along the sort of ridge you're on until you reach the first point you can go north at. Smash the rock that's in the way and continue north until you reach the second set of stairs. Go down them and continue a few steps north and then far west, smashing the rock in your way. Go up the stairs and fight the
Dragon Tamer
and
Black Belt
, then walk around the ledge you're on and go down the stairs. From there, keep going east (pushing the Strength rock in front of you) and go up the stairs at the end.
Back Room
Follow Buck into the cave ahead of you. He will pick up the Magma Stone... (an earthquake occurs!) and then leave. Exit the cavern (using an
Escape Rope
or the move
Dig
is the easiest, if you have it, but you must leave the third room first) and return to the
Survival Area
. Time to go look for Buck!
