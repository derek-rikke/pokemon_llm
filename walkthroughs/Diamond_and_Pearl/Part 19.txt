Team Galactic's final showdown
Dialga/Palkia unleashing its power
Cyrus
says that this world cannot be molded to the ultimate world he seeks and its far easier to create an entirely new one, then summons your
game mascot
(the Pokémon that appears on your game boxart) Dialga
D
/Palkia
P
, and an epic cutscene happens. Dialga/Palkia unleashes its power, spreading all over the
Sinnoh
region!
You can no longer turn back and leave. If you try to leave, Mars will stop you, asking if you really think that you can just run off. Get prepared because once you step forward, you can no longer switch the order of your Pokémon until all battles against
Team Galactic
are over.
VS Mars and Jupiter, Multi Battle with Barry
Make sure that you heal your Pokémon and check if you need to switch the order of your Pokémon before proceeding!
You'll have to battle Mars, Jupiter and Cyrus back to back.
Now, get ready and charge at Cyrus! But do you think you can really stop him by rushing forward? Of course not—
Commanders
Mars
and
Jupiter
will stop you. Mars says she will take you on first, and Jupiter says that she will be the next. However, just when you really think that you need to take them on one by one, your
rival
Barry
(or whatever you call him) bursts in and stands between you and either Mars or Jupiter, saying,
"Hold on one second!
Don't you start the party without me!"
Jupiter notices that Barry wants to take revenge on his earlier loss in
Lake Acuity
, and says that she and Mars are fine to face you off, two on two! So you will be in a
Multi Battle
again, with Rival Barry as your partner and the two commanders as your opponent.

Let's take a look at Barry's team first. It's good that Barry now has a full party.
Barry will always send out
Munchlax
at first. It is not really too helpful, but it can use
Screech
to make the Defense stat of 1 of opposing Pokémon plummets. This may sometimes help you. It can also follow up with
Body Slam
. The combo of Screech and Body Slam deals more damage than you'll expect.
Unlike those three you teamed up with in the past (
Cheryl
,
Mira
and
Riley
), if Barry's Munchlax faints, he will send in another Pokémon. He will send in different Pokémon depending on the situation, and even his
first partner Pokémon
when he is in a tight spot.
It is also nice to know that Barry's first partner Pokémon has finally evolved into its final form, gaining a lot of power and possessing moves with high power.
Now, let's take a look at Mars and Jupiter's team.
Mars and Jupiter always send in
Bronzor
first. Both of them know
Extrasensory
to attack,
Confuse Ray
to inflict confusion and have the
Ability
Levitate
to make all
Ground-type
moves like
Earthquake
or
Mud Bomb
miss, so
Fire-type
moves like
Flamethrower
are your only choices. Be careful if you are really using Fire-type Pokémon because one of the two Bronzor knows
Rock Slide
. The other knows
Gyro Ball
which takes advantage of Bronzor's low Speed stat. They can also use
Reflect
and
Light Screen
to reduce damage on their whole team for five turns.
It seems that their two Bronzor focus on annoying you more than attacking you. After they are unable to battle, Mars and Jupiter will send in their remaining Pokémon depending on the situation. This walkthrough will follow the list above.
Both of them also have
Golbat
in their team. Both Golbat know
Air Cutter
, which has a higher-than-average chance to land a critical hit. One knows
Poison Fang
, which may inflict bad poison,
Bite
, a
Dark-type
move that may cause flinching and will do quite a bit of damage to
Psychic-type
Pokémon, and
Confuse Ray
, while the other knows
Sludge Bomb
, which may inflict poison,
Mean Look
, which prevent you from switching out your Pokémon, and
Giga Drain
, which absorbs your Pokémon's health to heal itself, is out of your expectation and counters
Rock-type
Pokémon. Use
Rock-type
,
Psychic-type
, or
Electric-type
moves to take them out.
Next comes their strongest Pokémon— Mars's Level 45
Purugly
and Jupiter's Level 46
Skuntank
. Each of these two Pokémon have only one weakness—
Fighting-type
and Ground-type moves respectively. Be careful if you are using
Fighting-type
Pokémon or other Pokémon that are immune to
Normal-type
or
Poison-type
(meaning
Ghost-type
and
Steel-type
Pokémon)— Purugly has
Aerial Ace
and
Shadow Claw
, while Skuntank has Flamethrower. Purugly also knows
Slash
, which also has a higher critical-hit ratio, and
Hypnosis
, which makes your Pokémon fall asleep. Skuntank has
Poison Jab
, a powerful move that may inflict poison,
Night Slash
(again, has a higher chance to land a critical hit) and
SmokeScreen
, which reduces the your Pokémon's Accuracy.
After being defeated, Jupiter says that you are still no match for Cyrus. Barry says that you and him have "hit the wall", and helps you one last time by fully healing your Pokémon. Then he says that it's your show and bolts off.
VS Cyrus
Just then, Dialga
D
/Palkia
P
begins to create a new universe, and it seems as if the world is about to end......
But suddenly, the
Lake guardians
--
Uxie
,
Mesprit
and
Azelf
appear and stop the
Legendary Pokémon
from creating a new universe! Cyrus is outraged that the Red Chain has been destroyed -- crumbled away to nothing, the fact that Mesprit appear by your side, and the fact that his galaxy is gone. He swears again, this time swearing that he will capture those 3 again and craft another Red Chain! He also says:
"But before I even think about that,
I'm going to completely crush you!"
He challenges you again to a battle, but now, he is determined to completely crush you no matter what! This is a battle that you cannot lose— if you lose, the Sinnoh region, no, the whole world......no, the entire universe is doomed!

Jupiter is not lying and Cyrus is not joking either.
Cyrus's team is far stronger than what you will expect.
His Pokémon have all evolved into their final forms and gained 5 to 6 levels. Moreover, he has also added one more Pokémon. His team is almost totally offensive— be very careful and do not underestimate anything he sends out. All of his 4 Pokémon still share the same common weaknesses-- Rock-type moves, but since they are much stronger, even a strong Rock-type move like Rock Slide cannot wipe out his whole team.
His first Pokémon is
Honchkrow
, which evolved from his
Murkrow
. It possesses
Dark Pulse
(a move that may cause flinching),
Embargo
(you know, prevents you from using items),
Drill Peck
and
Steel Wing
(to cover its Rock-type and
Ice-type
weaknesses), and may also raise its Defense.
Electric-type
moves are your best bet.
His Golbat has evolved into
Crobat
. (Is his Golbat really
happy
to have Cyrus as its Trainer?) Crobat is very fast, probably outspeeding all of your Pokémon! It has
Cross Poison
(has high critical hit ratio and may inflict poison),
Air Slash
, Confuse Ray and Bite. Not too different from the Golbat you just faced, except that Crobat is much speedier, has more power and its Cross Poison can hit far harder.
His new Pokémon is a
Gyarados
. It seems that you'll need to go with Electric-type attacks (you should know that Electric-type attacks are its bane and deal significant damage on it) or Rock-type attacks, but it possesses
Aqua Tail
, as well as
Earthquake
, which may take your Electric-type Pokémon out by surprise! It also knows
Ice Fang
, which may freeze your Pokémon or make them flinch, and
Giga Impact
, which hits extremely hard! Although this counterpart of
Hyper Beam
forces Gyarados to waste a turn to recharge, Gyarados' high Attack stat makes this move very dreadful. This Gyarados is absolutely different from the Gyarados you faced before.
His strongest Pokémon
Sneasel
has evolved into
Weavile
and is now at
Lv.48
. That's right,
Level 48
— stronger by one level than the Legendary Pokémon you'll face very soon! Weavile has high Attack and extremely high Speed, making it very dangerous. If your Pokémon is slower than Crobat, don't think about outspeeding Weavile. Moreover, it is no longer fragile like when it was a Sneasel. It has Night Slash,
Ice Punch
, which may freeze your Pokémon,
Brick Break
(so don't try Rock-type or Steel-type moves against Weavile), and
X-Scissor
, a powerful
Bug-type
move. Its major weaknesses are Fighting-type moves, but even hitting back with your own Brick Break may not knock it out, so don't even think that
Mach Punch
or
Rock Smash
can deal serious damage. Stronger moves like
Close Combat
are your best choices.
If you successfully forced Cyrus to send out his last Pokémon, he will admit that you have pushed him to his extreme. He also says that losing is not possible for him. He may use a
Super Potion
on his Pokémon when they have only half or less HP left (i.e. HP bar is in yellow), and if they are in danger (HP bar is in red. In other words, critical health), he will use a
Full Restore
, especially if it is his last Pokémon, so watch out and use the most powerful moves you've got!
After beating Cyrus, he says,
"I won't admit this! The power spoken of in mythology... I didn't just make it obey me, I made it my own!"
He then adds,
"What is truly ultimate to you? What do you consider perfection? The most important thing... What shines the brightest... Telling you is meaningless. But I will not give up. I will become a deity one day... And I will make the ultimate mine..."
Mars, Jupiter and Cyrus, as well as other
Galactic Grunts
, vanish in a second. Team Galactic is utterly destroyed and finally out of the way. However, with the Legendary Pokémon in front of you, it is clear that you are still not done at
Spear Pillar
!
Catching Dialga/Palkia
Professor Rowan
arrives with his aide Dawn/Lucas and explains that you have to battle the Legendary Pokémon Dialga
D
/Palkia
P
, which is enraged and entrusts you to stop it. He will also stop you from leaving. Unfortunately, unlike Barry, they won't heal your Pokémon, so you need to do it by yourself. Don't step forward until you are ready --
about 5 more steps, and you will be in the battle!
Make sure that you fully heal your Pokémon and save your game before stepping forward!
Now that you are ready, go forth. Dialga
D
/Palkia
P
will roar, and then draw you into a battle!
You can encounter Dialga or Palkia only once, so don't knock it out. Instead,
catch it!
But
DO NOT use your
Master Ball
!
Compared to other Legendary Pokémon, Dialga/Palkia is easier to catch (Dialga's/Palkia's catch rate is 30, as opposed to the other Legendary Pokémon, which have catch rate of only 3). It isn't worth it to use the precious Master Ball on Dialga/Palkia.
Both Dialga and Palkia are partly
Dragon-type
Pokémon. They are at Lv.47 and have high stats, especially Sp. Atk. Moreover, their signature moves are Special-based. Their moves can be extremely deadly!

Roar of Time
Dragon
Special
--
Dialga is a Steel/Dragon-type Pokémon. Its
signature move
Roar of Time
is the Dragon-type version of Hyper Beam. It can deal very serious damage on your Pokémon or even render yours unable to battle in a single shot, but requires Dialga to recharge afterwards, wasting a turn and therefore giving you an opportunity to throw an Ultra Ball or a Dusk Ball. It possesses
Ancient Power
that might increase all of its stats at once, and it also has
Dragon Claw
and
Metal Claw
, which may raise its Attack stat.
Start off by inflicting status ailments on it, such as putting it to sleep, paralyzing it or freezing it. Don't burn it, otherwise the burn may knock it out. Its Steel type makes it immune to any
Poison-type
attacks, so it is impossible to poison it. Follow up by an attack that is super effective. In this case, Fighting-type or Ground-type moves. Then damage it little by little with attacks that are not very effective, such as Normal-type and
Grass-type
moves, until its HP bar is in red. After that, you can start throwing Poké Balls.
Due to its type, none of the special versions of Poké Balls have extra effectiveness on Dialga. You'll have to use
Ultra Balls
(or
Dusk Balls
if you're playing at night). Keep throwing until you successfully catch it.

Palkia is a
Water
/
Dragon
-type Pokémon. Its signature move
Spacial Rend
is not as deadly as Dialga's Roar of Time, but Spacial Rend has a higher chance of landing critical hits, and Palkia doesn't need to recharge. It possesses
Water Pulse
that may confuse your Pokémon. It also has
Ancient Power
(might raise all of its stats at once) and
Dragon Claw
to attack, similar to Dialga.
Start off by inflicting status ailments on it, such as putting it to sleep, paralyzing it or freezing it. Don't burn or poison it, otherwise the burn/poison may knock it out. Follow up by an attack that is super effective. In this case, only Dragon-type moves like Dragon Claw. If Dragon-type attacks are not available, use any attacks that have normal effectiveness on Palkia, such as Electric-type moves like
Thunderbolt
, Grass-type moves like
Petal Dance
or Ice-type moves like
Ice Beam
. Then damage it little by little with attacks that are not very effective, such as Fire-type moves, until its HP bar is in red. After that, you can start throwing Poké Balls.
Due to Palkia's Water type, there is now a special version of Poké Balls that works best on Palkia—
Net Balls
, the Poké Balls for Water-type and Bug-type Pokémon. Keep throwing Net Balls (you can also use Dusk Balls if you are playing at night) until you successfully catch it.
I failed, now what?
If you accidentally knock Dialga or Palkia out, run out of Poké Balls or get defeated, just soft reset your game and try catching again. That's why you were strongly recommended to save your game before proceeding to catch Dialga/Palkia.
Afterwards......
After catching Dialga/Palkia, Professor Rowan will say that he doesn't know how you did it and has never been this thrilled. Then Dawn/Lucas will say that it's time to go home and brings you away to the south. Prof. Rowan says that no one has the right to take away the others' world. Then the screen switches to the entrance of Spear Pillar. Don't leave yet, though— walk all the way north, past where you fought Dialga/Palkia, and you can collect either the
Adamant Orb
D
or the
Lustrous Orb
P
. The Adamant Orb can only be held by Dialga and will boost its Steel-type and Dragon-type attacks. The Lustrous Orb can only be held by Palkia and will boost its Water-type and Dragon-type attacks.

Now you can really leave. You cannot use

Escape Rope
either. Remember that there is a tunnel where some Galactic Grunt were in to distract you? Now that Team Galactic is gone, you can go through the tunnel. It functions as a shortcut to the exit.
