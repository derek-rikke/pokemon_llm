Pokémon League (Victory Road Entrance)
Sunyshore Gym
Make sure that you heal your Pokémon before entering the Gym.
The
Sunyshore Gym
is the final Gym you'll challenge in the game, so the Trainers and Gym Leader
Volkner
have Pokémon above Level 40. It's recommended that you train your Pokémon until they're above Level 45 before challenging the Gym.
This Gym specializes in
Electric-types
.
Ground-type
Pokémon are the best here because they're immune to Electric-type moves and can deal super-effective damage.
Grass-types
are also decent choices because they can resist Electric-type moves. However, the Trainers, as well as Volkner, use teams with other types, so along with Pokémon with Ground-type moves, you should also bring Pokémon with
Dark
-,
Bug
-,
Ghost
-,
Fighting
-,
Flying
-,
Fire
-,
Water
-, Electric- and/or
Grass
-type moves (you don't really need to bring Pokémon with all 9 types of moves. For example, if you have a Pokémon with Ghost-type attacks, you don't need to bring Pokémon with Dark-, Bug-, and Flying-type moves) to counter Pokémon in different types.
Layout of first room.
Layout of second room.
Layout of third room.
There are three rooms in this Gym. In each, there are several gears with bridges on them. Step on the buttons on the bridges to rotate the gears. There are three different colors of buttons: green, blue and red. A blue button turns the gear you are stepping on clockwise 90 degrees, while a green button turns the gear anticlockwise (or counterclockwise, both words have the same meaning) 90 degrees. A red button turns the gear you're stepping on clockwise 180 degrees. It's important to remember that
all of the other gears will also turn when you step on a button.
It is rumored that the "gear challenge" was designed by Leader Volkner out of boredom.
Turn the gears and fight the Trainers along to find your way to the next room or Leader Volkner.
Upon entering the Gym, step on the right-hand green switch once and the left green switch once. Follow the path and go to the next room. In the second room, step on the blue switch three times. Go up the stairs on the left, and step on the blue switch once. Step on the green switch and go to the right then up the stairs. In the third room, step on the right red switch once, the left red switch once, and then go up the left side. Step on the green switch twice, then the blue switch. Go down the right side down to where you started. Hit the right red switch once, then run up the right side to get to the Gym Leader.

Volkner has four Pokémon in his team, but only two of them are Electric-types. Three of his Pokémon have
Charge Beam
, which is an attack that looks weak, but has a high chance of raising the user's Special Attack. The other two Pokémon may catch you off guard if not prepared.
Volkner starts off with his
Raichu
. A good Ground-type move like
Earthquake
will finish it off quickly. Although
Thunder Wave
can paralyze your Pokémon and
Light Screen
reduces all Special damage by half, don't worry too much about its attacks because it doesn't have
Thunderbolt
or its evolutionary line's
signature move
,
Volt Tackle
. Be wary if your Ground-type Pokémon is partly Rock-type because Raichu knows
Brick Break
.
Ambipom
(a very random choice for an Electric-type specialist, and the evolution of
Aipom
) is a
Normal-type
Pokémon, which means that only Fighting-type moves can deal super-effective damage. Two of its moves are
Agility
and
Nasty Plot
, which boost Speed and Sp. Atk respectively.
Baton Pass
will force it to switch out, but the Pokémon that comes in will gain all of Ambipom's stat changes. Its only offensive move
Shock Wave
may look weak, but being a variation of
Aerial Ace
and
Swift
, it never misses. Moreover, Ambipom's
Ability
Technician
will boost the power of this move because its base power is only 60!
Volkner's
Octillery
, a
Water-type
, tends to surprise people who don't know Volkner's team before they challenge him. As such, it's weak to your own Electric-type attacks. Strong Grass-type moves may also work against it, but be careful of
Aurora Beam
if you're using a Grass-type Pokémon. It can also use
Bullet Seed
, which is a random choice (unless you, unwisely, use Ground-type Pokémon against Octillery). It also possesses its
signature move
Octazooka
, which shoots ink to attack and reduce your Pokémon's Accuracy.
Then comes his strongest Pokémon:
Luxray
(the evolution of
Luxio
) at Level 49. Its
Thunder Fang
can inflict paralysis or make your Pokémon flinch while dealing damage.
Crunch
may reduce your Pokémon's Defense stat. With Luxray's high Attack, this combination can be a threat. Its lower Special Attack makes Charge Beam deal less damage, but you still need to watch out. It doesn't have the ability
Intimidate
, so your Physical-based attacks won't be weakened, but that means it will have
Rivalry
instead. Be careful if you're sending in a
male
Pokémon— Rivalry boosts Luxray's Attack when it's facing a Pokémon of the same gender!
After you defeat Volkner, he'll give you the
Beacon Badge
and
TM57
(
Charge Beam
). You can also now use
Waterfall
outside of battle. You can finally challenge the
Pokémon League
... but you still don't have
HM07
(
Waterfall
)! Now what?
Sunyshore City
Leave the Sunyshore Gym, heal your Pokémon at the Pokémon Center, and then go to the beach where
Jasmine
is. Talk to her. She will notice that you now have the Beacon Badge, and give you
HM07
(
Waterfall
). Now you can finally climb waterfalls! Note that you'll also need
HM03
(
Surf
) in order to utilize this HM, because all waterfalls are in water.
You can now proceed to
Route 223
, but you may also want to check out places that you've been to before that have waterfalls.
Now that you can use Waterfall...
There are a few places that you couldn't fully navigate due to waterfalls in your way. With Waterfall, you can access those places and grab the items.

Trainers with a
Vs. Seeker
by their names, when alerted for a rematch using the item, may use higher-level Pokémon.
Make sure that you heal your Pokémon before proceeding. You'll need to bring Pokémon with
Surf
and
Waterfall
.
It's a good idea to have your leading Pokémon hold an
Amulet Coin
or a
Luck Incense
to gain double prize money after Trainer battles, as you may need to buy a lot of items to get through the next section of this journey.
Route 223
is the longest water route in the entire
Sinnoh
region, and has many Trainers. However, there are only three items for you to collect. To access the Route, return to Sunyshore City and Surf north of Jasmine. After a few "steps," you'll be on your way.
The Trainers use mostly
Water-type
Pokémon and the wild Pokémon are all Water-types, so this is a good training place for your
Electric
- and
Grass
-types. Fight all of the Trainers along the way. Keep in mind that you are mainly heading north, but you should also go back and forth between west and east sides of this Route to fight all Trainers. This is very important, since you'll need all the training you can get before you face the
Pokémon League
at the end of the upcoming journey.
Also, there is new Pokémon for you to catch:
Mantyke
, a
Water
/
Flying
-type Pokémon, and the newly added pre-evolution of
Mantine
. The evolving method is extremely strange— you'll need to level it up while having a
Remoraid
(you can conveniently use your
Good Rod
to hook one up here) in your party.
You can collect a
Big Pearl
at northeast of
Swimmer
Aubree, and
TM18
(
Rain Dance
) among a jumble of rocks on the west side.
On the island, in order to obtain the
Pearl
, you have to enter from the southeast. Then, head north to grab the item, return to where you stopped Surfing, go west to fight
Sailor
Zachariah, then Surf west and turn north again.
After that, follow the path and continue Surfing. Fight the Trainers on the way and head north until you see the big waterfall. Climb it, and you're done with this Route.
Pokémon League (Victory Road Entrance)
You've reached Sinnoh's
Pokémon League
. But you cannot challenge the
Elite Four
yet. The biggest and final test before the
Elite Four
challenge is waiting right here, through the nearby cave entrance. It's the Sinnoh
Victory Road
, a mazelike cavern filled with tough Trainers and Pokémon. However, DO NOT rush inside! You'll find a Pokemon Centre on the left.
Take advantage of the Pokémon Centre. You will be extremely grateful for a fully-healed team, so
heal up here
before continuing. After getting out of the Pokémon Centre, you can also
Fly
off to other places to buy items you might need (as listed in the next section of this walkthrough), and Fly back here without going through Route 223 again.
