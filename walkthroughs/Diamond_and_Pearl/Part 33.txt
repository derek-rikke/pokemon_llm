A colored background means that the Pokémon can be found in this location in the specified game. A white background with a colored letter means that the Pokémon cannot be found here.
The
Resort Area
is a good place to heal before continuing. This town lacks a
Poké Mart
, unfortunately for some players. The large building with the purple roof is the
Ribbon Syndicate
, a place you can only enter for the first time if the number of different kinds of
Ribbons
owned by your party is ten or more. (For example, six Sinnoh Champ Ribbons only count as one kind of Ribbon.) On the first floor, you can buy extremely expensive (and rather useless) Ribbons, one of which can make you bankrupt-- it costs
$
999,999! The second floor is where you can get spa treatments to raise the
friendship
level of one of your Pokémon (including eggs) once per day. Other than that, there isn't much of interest. Pick the Berries from the trees in the south of the town. When you're ready, return to
Route 229
.
Back to Route 229
Heal your Pokémon before proceeding. You'll need to bring Pokémon with
Surf
and
Rock Smash
.
Explore the area with long grass if you didn't do so. Otherwise, continue west to
Route 230
.

A colored background means that the Pokémon can be found in this location in the specified game. A white background with a colored letter means that the Pokémon cannot be found here.
Keep surfing west to the island. Going through the
tall grass
may be a pain to find the items. Use a
Repel
if you like. It's worth noting that
Togepi
can be caught here with the
Poké Radar
! When you're done exploring, continue Surfing west. You'll eventually end up back in the
Fight Area
.
Back in Fight Area
Returning to the
Fight Area
means that you've explored the entire
Battle Zone
!
Rival Rematch
Make sure that you heal your Pokémon and have them at or above Lv.60 before proceeding!
Every weekend (Saturday and Sunday),
Rival
Barry
will stop his training in
Stark Mountain
and wait for you in front of the gate to the
Battle Park
. Talk to him when you're prepared, and he'll ask for a rematch. Get ready for a fierce battle!
Initial rematch
His team is now far stronger than the fight in Pokémon League Main Building. With his Pokémon around Lv.60 and his
first partner Pokémon
at Lv.64, this rematch can be as tough as the battle with
Champion
Cynthia
!

The hardest challenge!
If you defeat the
Elite Four
and Champion 20 times, Barry's Pokémon will each increase in
level
by 10, and his
prize money
upon being defeated will increase to
$
7,400. Moreover, his Pokémon will also learn many new powerful moves! This will be the most difficult fight in the whole game, even harder than the Champion battle.
Don't you dare to fight him unless you have your Pokémon at around Lv.70!!

Afterwards......
Congratulations! You have completed the after game storyline!
There are still some things for you to do, though. Look at your
Trainer Card
. You can actually get more
Trainer stars
! You can aim for defeating Trainers in
Battle Tower
100 times in a row, winning a Master Rank in a
Super Contest
and try to get a
platinum flag in the Underground
. But don't forget about the biggest aim— catching all Pokémon and completing the Pokédex! Finishing these four jobs will give you the four remaining stars.
Players! It's time to get all 5 trainer stars and complete your game! These are difficult jobs for sure, but with determination, you'll ultimately succeed!
