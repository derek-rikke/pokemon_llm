Raiding Galactic HQ (Part 1)
Snowpoint Gym
Layout of the Snowpoint Gym.
Make sure that you heal your Pokémon before entering the Gym.
It is also recommended that you train your Pokémon until they are at about Level 40 before challenging the Gym.
This Gym specializes in
Ice-type
. The Gym Leader is
Candice
. Her strongest Pokémon is at level 42. Be sure to bring Pokémon with
Fire-type
and
Fighting-type
moves. Pokémon with
Rock-type
or
Steel-type
moves will also help a lot. As the Trainers and Leader Candice have diverse teams consisting other Pokémon (especially
Water-type
Pokémon) and even some unexpected ones (such as
Medicham
and
Steelix
), bringing Pokémon with
Electric-type
,
Grass-type
and
Flying-type
or
Ghost-type
moves are also recommended. Grass-type and Flying-type Pokémon are weak to Ice-type moves, which you should know. Rock-type Pokémon are not, but the Grass/Ice-type Pokémon
Snover
are very common in this Gym, and those Snover can have some Grass-type moves to attack.
If
Chimchar
was your starter Pokémon, its evolved form
Monferno
or final form
Infernape
will help you beat the Gym easily. The only other Fire-type Pokémon found in the wild in
Sinnoh
are
Ponyta
and its evolution
Rapidash
.
Empoleon
is pretty helpful, too. With its types, it has a double resistance to Ice-type moves, and if it knows some Steel-type moves, it will not only get same-type attack bonus, but it will be super effective as well.
The Snowpoint Gym puzzle consists of a four-level ice rink with ramps connecting the various floors. Step on a tile of ice, and you'll slide all the way until you hit a wall, an obstacle (a snowball as well if you don't have enough speed), a Trainer, or a snow tile. There are several snowballs that are blocking the stairs to the Gym Leader. You must destroy them by sliding down the ramps at them from a level high enough. You'll gain more power and speed if you slide from a higher level.
After destroying the snowballs and fighting all Trainers, go back to the exit (but don't go out, or the puzzle will reset) and head directly north, going through all stairs along the way. You will end up in front of Candice. Talk to her when you are ready to start the battle.

All of Candice's Pokémon are weak to Fire-type moves except for her
Medicham
. Ice-type Pokémon are also weak to Fighting-type, Steel-type and Rock-type moves. Candice sends out her
Snover
first. Its
Ability
Snow Warning
will make it begin to
hail
, damaging every Pokémon that isn't at least partly Ice-type. Try not to let this bother you and quickly defeat it. Its major weakness is Fire-types move like
Flame Wheel
.
Sneasel
shouldn't be too much of a threat, but it is very fast, and will probably outspeed your Pokémon even if you are using speedy Pokémon like Infernape. It also has high Attack stat, but its defensive stats clearly aren't the best. Its typing (
Dark
/Ice) also gives it a major weakness: Fighting-type moves. Even one hit of
Mach Punch
or
Rock Smash
can deal serious damage on it, and a stronger Fighting-type move like
Brick Break
will render it unable to battle. If you don't have Pokémon with Fighting-type moves, land two or three hits on Sneasel from a Rock-type move like
Rock Throw
or a Steel-type move like
Metal Claw
, and it's gone. Candice has a Pokémon you probably didn't expect: Medicham. It is a Fighting/
Psychic
-type Pokémon. It is weak to Flying-type moves (like
Fly
) and Ghost-type moves (like
Shadow Ball
). Avoid sending in a Flying-type Pokémon if you can because Medicham has
Ice Punch
. Candice's strongest Pokémon is her
Abomasnow
, which is the evolution of Snover and can confuse your Pokémon with
Swagger
or put them to sleep with
GrassWhistle
, which fortunately has low accuracy. It also knows
Wood Hammer
, a Grass-type move that has 120 base power (so don't use Rock-type Pokémon against it). However, Wood Hammer deals recoil damage. Abomasnow's Speed stat isn't the best, so hit it with a strong Fire-type move (like
Flamethrower
or
Fire Blast
) before it can hurt you.
After being defeated, Candice will give you the Icicle Badge, which will allow you to use
HM08
(
Rock Climb
) (which was located northeast of the Hiker's house on
Route 217
) outside of battle. Candice will also give you
TM72
(
Avalanche
), an Ice-type move whose base power doubles if the Pokémon that uses it has been hurt by the opponent in the same turn, but forces the user to go last.
Now you should stop by the Pokémon Center, then head back to
Acuity Lakefront
.
Back to Acuity Lakefront
The
Galactic Grunts
are still there, but they won't be blocking the entrance to the lake. Head inside
Lake Acuity
.
Lake Acuity
You'll see Rival
Barry
battling Commander
Jupiter
. It seems that Barry has lost and failed to protect
Uxie
. Jupiter talks to you about where Uxie and the other 2
Lake guardians
are: the
Galactic HQ
in
Veilstone City
. She then leaves without battling you. Barry says that he must get stronger "not just because of winning or losing", then disappears.
Surf around and collect
TM14
(
Blizzard
). There is still nothing inside

Afterwards, you'll need to fly to Veilstone City. But you can check out other places before proceeding.
Now that you can use Rock Climb...
Using
Rock Climb
there are some new places for you to access, where you can find more items and Trainers. You'll find it useful in these places to have your

Surf across the northern pond, then head to where you can use Rock Climb. Climb up and go up the stairs.
There are several items for you to collect on this floor.
The tunnel to further areas is blocked by a cave painting identical to the one in the

TM13
(
Ice Beam
), which contains a powerful
Ice-type

Veilstone City
With the ability to use Rock Climb in the field, there is also an item for you to get before you proceed. There is a
Full Incense
for you to grab southeast of the Gym.
Now head to the northeast part of the city. Go up the stairs, and you are at the highest point of the city, where the Galactic HQ is. A Galactic Grunt tells you that you need a key to access. Then he accidentally drops an item when he runs away. Pick it up and you'll find that it is the
Storage Key
. You may wonder if you can use it to access the HQ, so head inside. Use the door in the middle or on the left. The right one is a one-way exit.

After getting down the stairs, you will find two corridors, one to the north and another to the east. If you take the way heading north, you can talk to a Scientist (who won't fight you), but you can do nothing else until you find the key. Head east and fight the grunts along the way. Then go up the stairs, and you will be in isolated parts of Galactic HQ. Yep, this is a tunnel linking the warehouse and HQ.
Now you have to fight all grunts and even
Scientists
along the way. If you remember those evil Scientists who worked for
Team Rocket
in previous games, you'll realize the same scenario happens right here. You will also encounter some yellow
warp panels
, which teleport you to different rooms when you step on them. Go through all stairs and warp panels to collect all items and fight all Trainers. After going up the stairs in the tunnel you will be in a room with a grunt and more stairs. Go up the stairs and you will find yourself in a room with a grunt and two warp panels behind the grunt, one on the left and one directly behind the grunt. Taking the one directly behind the grunt will send you to a dead end. Taking the left one will send you to a room with a laptop on the left and another warp panel to the right. This will send you to a room with some more stairs. These stairs will take you to a room with a warp panel to the left, stairs on the right and a grunt in the middle. Take the warp panel. you will be sent to a room that is empty except for some stairs on the right, taking those will result in you being sent to another room that is almost empty, except for the stairs on the right and a scientist next to them. Taking the stairs will send you back to tunnel connecting the
Galactic Warehouse

It is time to raid the base of
Team Galactic
! Get back to
Galactic HQ
and go inside from the middle or left door. Check the door near the reception again. Use
Galactic Key
you got earlier to open it, then go up the stairs.
There is a hidden item near the stairs. Grab it, then proceed. Fight the Trainers along the way. You'll see "Team Galactic TV Room" after fighting the grunts, but don't go inside for now. Go through the warp panel in the southeast corner and follow the warp path to collect an item. The northeast warp is a dead end. After that, go inside the TV Room. Fight the
Scientist
, then go through the warp panel.
You'll end up in the entrance of "Team Galactic Nap Room". (Can you believe that the boss of
Team Galactic
cares about the grunts so much? Even a sleeping place for them is provided!) Just like the Snowbound Lodge on
Route 216
, you can sleep on a bed (but be sure to check if it is occupied before sleeping on it). Get onto the bed, press down on Control Pad, press A, then answer "Yes". Your Pokémon will be fully healed. Make good use of this Nap Room!
After taking a nap, go up the stairs. There will be a double battle. Then you'll see three warp panels. The warp on the right is a dead end. The middle warp brings you to a room with an Elixer. The offset left warp lets you proceed. Finally, another flight of stairs takes you to a door that can be opened with the Galactic Key. Open the door, but don't step forward......
one more step and you'll be in a boss battle!
