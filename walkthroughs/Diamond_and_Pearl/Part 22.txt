Final Rival Battle
Before proceeding......
Make sure that you are fully prepared!
Be warned— A tough and long journey is up ahead.
The Sinnoh
Victory Road
is very complicated. A lot of Trainers are there to challenge you. It is a very harsh test, but is a necessary training for the challenges of the Pokémon League.
Make sure that you have done the following things before going on:
Buy a lot of medicines.
Buy at least 30 of each necessary medicine
, excluding different versions of Potions.
Buying 35 to 40 of each is recommended.
To save money, don't buy
Super Potions
, and don't buy too many bottles of
Potion
.
You may still need to buy many bottles of
Hyper Potion
and
Full Restore
, though.
Buy
Drinks
(i.e. Fresh Water, Soda Pop, Lemonade, Moomoo Milk) instead of the Potions. You should know where to buy them, but in case you forgot:
Fresh Water, Soda Pop, Lemonade:
Vending Machines
on
Veilstone Department Store
's fifth floor
Moomoo Milk: Cafe Cabin,
Route 210
Buy a few bottles of Repel in any of the 3 versions to get some items more easily.
If you are buying
Repels
, buy at most 10 bottles.
If you are buying
Super Repels
, buy no more than 8 bottles.
If you are buying
Max Repels
, buy no more than 6 bottles.
Heal your Pokémon.
Always let your leading Pokémon hold
Amulet Coin
or
Luck Incense
to gain double prize after Trainer battles, especially if you're running out of money.
Bring Pokémon with the following
HM
moves:
Surf
Strength
Rock Smash
Waterfall
Rock Climb
Train your Pokémon until they are above Level 50.
Having your Pokémon at about Level 55 is recommended.
If your Pokémon are at or below Level 45, DO NOT even dare to proceed!
Sinnoh Victory Road
This is the final journey that you must take before challenging the
Pokémon League
. There are 3 levels that you can now access. Go inside when you are ready.
1F (Part 1)
1F
First, cross the bridge, climb down the wall, head west to fight
Psychic
Bryce and collect
TM41
(
Torment
). Next, head east from Bryce and get the hidden
Ultra Ball
in one of the rocks at the southeast part. Then, head back to where you climbed down. Climb up and head east.
Cross the bridge and go down the stairs. Fight
Bird Keeper
Hana and head north to grab the
Full Heal
. After that, head back to the stairs and cross the bridge to the north. Then climb down the wall and head west.
Follow the path (be careful that you don’t jump down the ledge) and go up the stairs. Fight
Ace Trainer
Mariah and head north. Don’t go up the stairs yet -- collect the hidden
Max Elixir
in a rock at the north first. Then head back to the stairs and go up to 2F.

First, head west, smash the rock and push the boulder to the west. Next, push the boulder near the ramp to the east. Then, use a
Repel
,
Super Repel
or
Max Repel
, get on your
bicycle
, set it to the fourth gear and ride on the ramp to fly over the rock. After that, smash the rock near another ramp, switch to the third gear, ride on the ramp and head north, then west for a
Max Ether
. Jump down the ledge, switch back to the fourth gear, go all the way east and fly over the rock, then head south and smash the rock to proceed. You will then see 3 boulders in this pattern:
11001
10XY1
100Z1
10011
Legend:
0 = empty tiles
1 = wall
2 = unbreakable rocks
alphabets (A, B, C, etc.) = boulders / breakable rocks
Push boulders in the following order:

Boulder X to the west
Boulder Z all the way to the south
Follow the path, fight Ace Trainer Omar, and you’ll see rocks arranged in the following pattern:
11000000
100ABCDE
10200000
100G1110
10001110
Solve the puzzle in the following order:
Push boulder A to the south
Go around the rock F
Smash rock G
Push boulder A back to its original place
Ignore boulder B. Follow the path, smash the rock, head east and fight Ace Trainer Sydney. Then follow the path and you’ll see another 3 boulders:
02011
00H00
0I0J1
1R111
Solve the puzzle in the following order:
Push boulder I to the east
Grab the hidden
Rare Candy
(marked as R in the picture)
Push boulder H all the way to the east

2F (Part 2)
Now you’re back to 2F, the boulders have been reset. Push boulder H to the south, then head east. Follow the path and you’ll see rocks arranged in the following pattern:
020K001
02L0101
00M1101
1101101
10N0000
1001100
Solve the puzzle in the following order:
Push boulder N all the way to the east
Head north and follow the path
Push boulder K to the west
Smash rock L
Push boulder M to the south
Afterwards, head west, turn north and follow the path. You’ll see some ramps. Use another bottle of Repel, Super Repel or Max Repel (by now the previous one should have worn off). Get on your bicycle again and start from the far east. Make sure that it is at the fourth gear, then go all the way west, riding through the ramps and flying over the rock. You can get the Full Restore.
Head deeper and fight
Double Team
Al and Kay. Then ride through the ramps again (use a bottle of Repel/Super Repel/Max Repel again if the previous one wears off), but this one is tricky – you have to stop at the right time. If you succeed, you can get
TM71
(
Stone Edge
). If you failed, try again and you’ll ultimately do it.

Surf east and stop surfing behind Valencia. Then surf across the pond to the south. Grab the hidden

and go up the stairs. Fight Double Team Jo and Pat, then surf across another pond to the west. Go up the stairs.

You’ll find someone blocking a cave to a deeper area, saying that you’ll become even tougher, and eventually the world will grow bigger to you. The cave will only open up when you get the National Pokédex, so ignore it for now and grab the
Zinc
to the south.
After that, go back and fight Veteran Edgar, then head south through the gap. You’ll see a T-junction. Don’t go east yet -- go west first. Climb up the wall, cross the bridge to the west, and go up the stairs.

A colored background means that the Pokémon can be found in this location in the specified game. A white background with a colored letter means that the Pokémon cannot be found here.
The ground floor of the building is a mixture of a Pokémon Center and a Poké Mart (although the theme is the one in Pokémon Centers).
DO NOT go all the way forward!
A tough battle awaits you. Instead,
heal your Pokémon FIRST
! Your Pokémon should be exhausted after the Victory Road journey. The Pokémon Center is on the left. Then buy items if you are running out of them. The Mart is on the right.
MAKE SURE that you HEAL your Pokémon and have your Pokémon AT LEVEL 50 at the very least BEFORE PROCEEDING to the Ace Trainer!
It is recommended that you train your Pokémon until they are around Level 55 before proceeding.
When you are ready, step forward to the Ace Trainer, and someone will burst in, saying:
"Hold it!
Don’t go off without me!"
Final Rival Battle
That "someone" is none other than Rival
Barry
. He says,
"Let’s see who’s more worthy of making the challenge with a battle!"
then challenges you to the final rival battle in the main storyline! (Well, he rarely falls behind you, and he did, coming here after your arrival.)

Barry’s team is now very strong -- far stronger than the team he has when you're in the
Multi Battle
on
Spear Pillar
,
Mt. Coronet
. His strongest Pokémon is again his own first partner Pokémon at its final form,
at Level 53
. All of his Pokémon have evolved into their final forms. They also possess moves that deals a lot of damage. However, you cannot lose this fight -- if you lose, you’re not worthy to challenge the
Elite Four
!
No matter which first partner you chose, his team will always have the following 3 Pokémon:
Staraptor
(which he always starts with),
Heracross
and
Snorlax
(Evolved from his
Munchlax
. It seems that Barry treated it well).
He’ll have 3 of the following 6 Pokémon, depending on your first partner Pokémon:
2 of these 3:
Rapidash
,
Roserade
,
Floatzel
1 of the final forms of the 3 first partners (
Torterra
,
Infernape
and
Empoleon
, at
Level 53
)
His Pokémon can hit really hard. Their moves can also cover a variety of types, so watch out! He’ll also use type-advantage to attack and send out Pokémon depending on the situation (i.e. what Pokémon you’re using), so try to use your own type-advantage to hit back.
After beating him, he’ll say that he’s not ready, order you not to lose, and bolts off.
Heal your Pokémon, but don't proceed further yet! You will have to do the most serious preparation ever!
