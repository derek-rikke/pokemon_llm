Route 215
On this route, it is generally raining which weakens
Fire-type
moves while strengthening
Water-type
moves. Once you climb up the stairs near the entrance, cross the bridge to find a Honey Tree. Then follow the path east and talk to the guy in the Black Belt clothes to receive
TM66
(
Payback
). Once you follow the path north and defeat the Black Belt Trainer, use
Cut
on the small tree to find another Black Belt Trainer, along with the
Fist Plate
, which enhances
Fighting-type
attacks.

Veilstone Gym
Veilstone City Pokémon Gym
Leader: Maylene
The Barefoot, Fighting Genius!
Once you are ready head to the southwest where the Gym is located. As you approach
Lucas
/
Dawn
will appear and see that you are tougher and say that they've seen the Game Corner and have been working on their Pokédex before leaving. This Gym is a
Fighting-type
Gym so you will need a
Flying-type
or
Psychic-type
Pokémon to take advantage of the weaknesses of Fighting-type Pokémon, or a
Ghost-type
Pokémon to shut them down due to the immunity. It is also recommended to also bring a
Fire-type
Pokémon such as
Monferno
or
Ponyta
, a
Ground-type
Pokémon (a
Shellos
with
Mud Bomb
may also work) or your own Fighting-type Pokémon like Monferno or
Machoke
for help in dealing with Maylene's
Lucario
which is part
Steel-type
, that can cause only normal damage with Flying-type and Psychic-type Pokémon.
Make sure that you heal your Pokémon before going into the Gym.
It is also recommended that you should train your Pokémon until they are at Level 27 or above.
The puzzle in the Gym is to move the special walls around to go through the small room blocks so you can line up the boxes in the middle to get to Leader
Maylene
. First head for the walls on the right and then move the ones between right and middle side blocks. Next, go through the walls to get the ones on right side corner of the Gym. This will help you reach the movable wall above for the top box in the middle row that will get you to Maylene.
Next deal with the movable walls on the left row. First head to the middle row and move the two walls, that should help you get to eventually move ones of the left side to get to the top of the left row to move the last wall. With the middle road clear you can now reach Maylene.

Getting back Lucas'/Dawn's Pokédex
Once you leave the Gym, Lucas/Dawn will be waiting for you, and explain that after dropping their Pokédex, Team Galactic found and took it, and needs you at the Galactic warehouse to get it back. It should be located near the Department store where the entrance is guarded by two male Team Galactic grunts. When ready talk to Lucas/Dawn to enter a Tag Battle.

Trainers with a

by their names, when alerted for a rematch using the item, may use higher-level Pokémon.
Once you defeat both grunts they return the stolen Pokédex and run away, but not before mentioning that contents from their warehouse has been moved to
Pastoria City
already. Lucas/Dawn thanks you and mentions that the Pastoria has the
Great Marsh
where many kinds of Pokémon are found. Quickly head into the warehouse to pick up
HM02
(
Fly
). Now that you have the Badge, you can use it outside of battle. Nothing else can be done here now. Use the southern gate to reach Route 214.
