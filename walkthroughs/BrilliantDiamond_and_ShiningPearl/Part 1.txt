Introduction
When you first turn on the game,
Professor Rowan
introduces himself, welcoming you to the world of Pokémon. Then, he throws a
Poké Ball
to demonstrate what a Pokémon is. A
Munchlax
then appears from the Poké Ball and Rowan goes on to speak about human relationships with Pokémon as friends. He then states that his job as a professor is to conduct research on these Pokémon.
You are then asked to choose your appearance, so choose wisely as you will be unable to change your basic appearance once you have started your adventure. You then must choose a name, which will also stay with you for the remainder of the game. You are than asked what
your friend's
name is. He will be your rival. His official name is Barry, so from now on, he is referred as "Barry" in this walkthrough.
Your adventure has begun, so it's time to jump into the world of Pokémon!
Twinleaf Town
Twinleaf Town
The journey begins at your home in
Twinleaf Town
. You are watching the television special report titled "Search for the Red Gyarados!" in which a news broadcast describes a team searching for a
red Gyarados
in a far-off lake (which is presumably the
Lake of Rage
in
Johto
). The broadcast states that the team has not observed the Pokémon in question.
On your way out of the house, your
mother
will tell you that your rival wishes to see you as it is an emergency. She also warns you to stay out the tall grass as
wild Pokémon
may attack. Just as you enter his house, Barry bumps into you. He tells you to come with him to
Lake Verity
and says that he will fine
$
1 million if you aren't there. As he is about to leave, Barry notices that he has forgotten something and runs back inside the house. Head inside and upstairs, where Barry is deciding what to bring. He then notices you, threatens to fine you
$
10 million (which is 10 times of the original amount) and rushes out of the house. He will now be waiting for you on
Route 201
. Now head north to reach the route.
Route 201
Barry sees you and follows you. If you turn east and try to go through the tall grass, your Mom's words will suddenly pop out of nowhere and prevent you from entering tall grass. Head west and go to
Verity Lakefront
.
Verity Lakefront
Verity Lakefront
This is a short path that leads you to the lake. Follow the path and head into Lake Verity. Once you can go to Route 201, you can get a hidden Potion here that is accessed from the route.

Lake Verity
After you reach Route 201, Barry tells you about the news report on TV about the Red Gyarados. He wants to go to the local lake to see if there is a similar Pokémon, and he will now follow you. Walk to
Lake Verity
. Upon your arrival, you see
Professor Rowan
, and either
Lucas
or
Dawn
(whoever is the opposite gender of your selected player character). The two are searching the lake for something and discuss Rowan's return to
Sinnoh
after four years. They push past you, and Lucas/Dawn apologizes. Barry goes to investigate the briefcase Rowan left behind, but when you enter the long grass you are each attacked by a wild
Starly
. You then open the briefcase to find three
Poké Balls
, containing
Turtwig
,
Chimchar
and
Piplup
.

When you choose one, that Pokémon will become your
first partner Pokémon
, so choose wisely. Barry will automatically select the one with a type advantage over yours.
Turtwig
, the Turtle Pokémon, is the physical all-rounder. Turtwig evolves into
Grotle
at Level 18, and then
Torterra
at level 32. Turtwig is a
Grass-type
Pokémon, and Torterra is a Grass/
Ground
-type Pokémon. Torterra has great physical Attack and Defense, but low Special Attack and Speed. It gets powerful moves like
Razor Leaf
and
Crunch
pretty early on, and later
Earthquake
. Torterra can also be taught
Wood Hammer
from the
Move Reminder
. Another good move for Torterra is
Curse
, which boosts its Attack and Defense, its two best stats, while decreasing its Speed, which is already very low. It also has access to
Synthesis
for self-healing. For TM moves, it has access to
Bullet Seed
,
Giga Impact
, and a wide range of other moves, including several setup moves. Torterra does have a major weakness to
Ice-type
attacks, so be wary of that, but it is otherwise neutral to most other types. Otherwise, Turtwig's type coverage excels at many of the Gyms and is a solid all-around choice.
Chimchar
, the Chimp Pokémon, is the glass cannon. It has high speed and attacking stats, at the cost of having quite low defenses (these are usual for
Fire-type
Pokémon). It serves as a mixed attacker, and can use both physical and special moves well. It evolves at Level 14 into
Monferno
, a Fire/
Fighting
-type Pokémon, and gains a ton of power. It learns one of the second strongest Fighting-type moves,
Close Combat
, when it evolves into
Infernape
. If you make sure that Chimchar evolves before or in the first Gym, you shouldn't have trouble with the
Rock-type
Pokémon. Its defenses are low, but due to its speed and offense, it often has the power to take out most Pokémon in the game with one or two hits before they even get a chance to strike. The Chimchar line can learn a variety of great moves, both with level up and TMs. It can learn
Flamethrower
at Level 47 if unevolved, but Monferno and Infernape can still learn it via TM35, which can be obtained before the sixth Gym.
Brick Break
,
Focus Blast
, and
Fire Blast
are also some TM moves to consider, although it can learn many, many more, like
Rock Slide
,
Stone Edge
,
Earthquake
and
Dig
. Chimchar's offensive coverage and speed makes it an extremely versatile attacker.
Piplup
, the Penguin Pokémon, is the special tank. It has high Special Defense and Special Attack, but low Attack and Speed. It evolves into
Prinplup
at Level 16. When it evolves further into
Empoleon
at Level 36, it gains the Steel type, making it a unique
Water
/
Steel
-type Pokémon. The addition of the Steel type makes it resistant to a majority of types, making it an excellent defensive wall. Its only weaknesses are
Electric
,
Fighting
, and
Ground
. Unfortunately, this good typing comes at a cost: a movepool that isn't the best. Despite its sub-par Attack stat, Empoleon learns more physical moves than special. Early on, it is better off using Special attacks such as
BubbleBeam
, which Prinplup learns at Level 24. If you are fine using TMs on Empoleon,
TM95
(
Surf
), and
TM91
(
Flash Cannon
) are both very powerful attacks. It also eventually gets the one of the strongest Water-type attacks,
Hydro Pump
, at Level 59, although it has low PP and accuracy. Other viable TM options include
Ice Beam
,
Scald
, and
Grass Knot
. Alternatively, it can learn
Swords Dance
from a TM or the
Move Reminder
, making its physical options usable. Piplup takes some external training to be used offensively, but it has the potential to be one of the best in both offense and defense.
All of the first partners are good choices and it is down to your personal preference to make a decision. In any case, it's time to move on.
Battle the Level 2 Starly, and defeat it to give your new Pokémon experience points. Suddenly, Lucas/Dawn returns and remarks that Rowan would be very angry if he/she forgot the briefcase. When Lucas/Dawn realizes that you have used the Pokémon from the briefcase, he/she takes the briefcase and hurries off. Barry suggests heading back to Twinleaf Town.
On your way back to Twinleaf Town, you meet Lucas/Dawn and
Professor Rowan
, who takes a look at the Pokémon you and Barry had taken and returns to his lab. Rowan's assistant mentions that you should stop by Rowan's lab and then hurries off.
Twinleaf Town
After that, you will automatically return to your house in Twinleaf Town. You explain the situation that occurred at the lake, and Mom gives you a pair of
Running Shoes
and asks you to visit Professor Rowan in
Sandgem Town
.

Professor Rowan's Lab
Sandgem Town
Upon reaching Sandgem Town, Professor Rowan's assistant will stop you and have you go with him/her. You are then shown the
Pokémon Research Lab
, the largest building in town. As you are about to enter, Barry zooms out and says that Rowan isn't as intimidating as he first seemed, and then departs for
Jubilife City
. After entering the lab, Professor Rowan examines the Pokémon you chose at the lake and lets you keep it as a gift. You will then be given the option to give it a
nickname
. The professor formally introduces himself, and entrusts you with a
Pokédex
to record the data of all the Pokémon that are found throughout the
Sinnoh
region. Lucas/Dawn also says that he/she is on a Pokédex quest.
Upon leaving the lab, Lucas/Dawn will give you a tour and show you the
Pokémon Center
and
Poké Mart
. He/she then insists that you tell your mom that you are leaving on a journey and leaves to
Route 202
, where he/she won't let you pass until you complete your mission in Twinleaf Town.

Backtrack on Route 201 and head to your house. After you get some rest, your mother is happy to hear the news and will give you the
Guidebook
, and she tells you to make sure to come back to visit. Barry's mother then stops by and admits that Barry left so fast that he forgot the
Parcel
, but your mother suggests that you can delivery this to Barry personally. Barry's mom mentions that Barry should be in
Jubilife City
right now.
Leave Twinleaf and return to Sandgem Town. You can head south to
Route 219
to pick up an
Antidote
, but you cannot explore the rest of this route until you gain access to
Surf
. Head north of Sandgem Town to reach Route 202.
