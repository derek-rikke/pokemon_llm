Route 202
When you first reach
Route 202
,
Professor Rowan
's assistant (
Lucas
/
Dawn
) will give a demonstration on how to catch Pokémon by catching a wild
Bidoof
. The assistant then gives you twenty
Poké Balls
. The Pokémon that Lucas/Dawn has is the
first partner Pokémon
that neither you nor
Barry
choose earlier. Before departing, Lucas/Dawn will mention that it is easier to capture a
wild Pokémon
if you lower the Pokémon's
Hit Points
more, and even easier if you inflict a
status condition
. Now that you can capture Pokémon, you can also
trade
between games through the
Pokémon Center
's
Union Room
.
Now that you can now use Poké Balls, it is recommended that you start catching a few Pokémon, such as
Starly
or
Shinx
. You will be facing
Barry
soon and his first partner Pokémon will be at the point where it will have a move of its own type in its arsenal, so your first partner Pokémon may need the extra backup.
After this point, you are off having some of your first Pokémon battles in the game. This is the first route where you can
battle
Trainers
. There are three Trainers here, none of which have a Pokémon stronger than
level
5.

A colored background means that the Pokémon can be found in this location in the specified game. A white background with a colored letter means that the Pokémon cannot be found here.
If you catch a
Bidoof
and
evolve
it into a
Bibarel
, it will become a
Normal
/
Water
-type Pokémon. Its stats are relatively mediocre, but it has a decent movepool via level up and
TM
.
Shinx
is a good pickup as a solid choice that evolves into
Luxio
and then
Luxray
. Shinx helps against
Flying-type
and
Water-type
Pokémon if you picked
Turtwig
or
Chimchar
respectively, and helps
Piplup
out as well, but Shinx's evolutionary line focuses on
Attack
instead of
Special Attack
, so
Special-based moves
such as
Discharge
that it learns quite late and
Thunderbolt
will not deal as much damage. Shinx and its evolutions can learn some
Physical-based
Electric-type
moves such as
Spark
,
Wild Charge
and
Thunder Fang
, as well as two
Dark-type
moves,
Bite
and
Crunch
. These moves don't come early, though.
Kricketot
is hard to use even when it evolves into
Kricketune
, mostly due to the fact that
Bug-type
moves have few advantages, while being resisted by many other types.
Starly
is one of the best
Flying-type
Pokémon in the game, especially when it evolves into
Staravia
and then
Staraptor
, getting
Close Combat
and
Brave Bird
. It has very high
Attack
to back these moves up, too.

Jubilife City
As you are about to enter
Jubilife City
,
Lucas

Dawn
approaches to tell you that your rival
Barry
is at the
Trainers' School
. Until you complete your missions here you cannot go east to
Route 203
. However, you can go north to
Route 204
to face more wild Pokémon and catch a
Budew
, which can help a little with your first
Gym
match, especially if you chose
Chimchar
.
Trainers' School
The Trainers' School
The building west of the
Pokémon Center
is the
Trainers' School
. Here, you meet Barry and give him the
Parcel
, which contains two
Town Maps
. Barry gives you one of them then leaves for
Oreburgh City
. There are two
Pokémon Trainers
that can be fought here, in the northeast corner of the school. After you beat them, you will receive 3 copies of
TM10
(
Work Up
).

Pokétch Company
The
Pokétch Company
makes a new appliance called the Pokémon Watch, or
Pokétch
for short. After you receive the
Town Map
, the owner of the company, who is in the center of town, will approach you. He tells you to bring him three
Coupons
from the
clowns
around the city, and he will give you a Pokétch. The clowns ask simple yes/no-questions about Pokémon (and the answer is always "Yes"). When you get the question correct, you receive the Coupon. After you get all three Coupons, return to the man to receive the Pokétch. You can get the three Coupons in any order because you can talk to the clowns in any order you like. Now you can access the Pokétch whenever you want, which is a good thing, since you can install the necessary
Hidden Moves
onto it to reach areas you couldn't before, once you obtain the necessary Gym
Badges
.
The Pokétch building is the northwest corner of the city. If you return after you receive an odd-numbered Badge (i.e., the
Coal Badge
,
Cobble Badge
,
Relic Badge
, and
Icicle Badge
), you can talk to the owner inside the building to receive a new
apps
for your Pokétch. Out of those you can receive from him, the
Marking Map
is one of the most useful apps because it can be used to track
Roaming Pokémon
.
Inside the building west of Jubilife City that leads to
Route 218
, you can receive the
Old Rod
from a
Fisherman
, who also offers to teach you
how to fish
. You can't do anything on Route 218 but fish until you get
Surf
, but you can catch a
Magikarp
here with your Old Rod. This is a useful Pokémon if you have enough patience, because while Magikarp is considered the weakest Pokémon ever, it evolves into the brutally powerful
Gyarados
, which is a great addition to a team and can learn many good moves, such as
Waterfall
,
Crunch
and the powerful setup move
Dragon Dance
. It can also get
Earthquake
,
Stone Edge
and
Avalanche
through TM for coverage.
Back in Jubilife City, the apartment east of the TV station has a blond-haired girl on the first floor that will give you a
Quick Claw
.

Once you have the
Town Map
and
Pokétch
, you can head east to
Route 203
, though you may want to head north to
Route 204
and catch some more Pokémon first. There are other places in Jubilife City, such as the
Jubilife TV
station and the
Global Wonder Station
, but you won't be able to access these places until you've obtained the Coal Badge, so it's best to move on.
Route 204
Here, you can catch some Pokémon and battle some Trainers, but you can't continue through the
Ravaged Path
until you get
Rock Smash
and the Coal Badge. You'll come back here eventually, though, and once you do, you'll be able to explore the northern portion of this route.

Budew
is a
Grass
/
Poison
-type Pokémon. It evolves into
Roselia
if leveled up during the day when its
friendship
is high, and will evolve again into the new final form
Roserade
when a
Shiny Stone
is used. The Roselia evolutionary line has very high
Special Attack
and can learn the whole line of
Absorb
. Budew starts of with Absorb, picks up
Mega Drain
and eventually
Giga Drain
if evolved. Be sure to evolve it because Budew doesn't learn any good moves after picking up Mega Drain, unless it evolves. Try to let Budew evolve at or before Level 19 because that's when Roselia learns
Magical Leaf
. Afterwards, Roselia can learn
Petal Dance
. When Roselia evolves into Roserade, it doesn't learn any more moves, but its Special Attack will skyrocket. Roselia's evolutionary line can also learn
SolarBeam
and
Sludge Bomb
through
TMs
, making use of their high Sp. Atk.
You can encounter Zubat at night, or if you head into Ravaged Path.

Zubat
is a
Poison
/
Flying
-type Pokémon. Zubat will evolve into
Golbat
starting at Level 22, then into
Crobat
when Golbat has high friendship. Zubat starts off with only
Astonish
as a physical attacking option and is stuck with just that until it gets
Poison Fang
. Golbat will pick up
Bite
. Crobat has the same moveset as Golbat, except that it can relearn
Cross Poison
and learn
Fly
via
TM
. Zubat will struggle a lot early on, but it will be more useful when it evolves into Golbat. You should know that the Zubat evolutionary line has high Speed. When Golbat evolves again into Crobat, it be able to will outspeed most of the Pokémon you'll fight.
Geodude
is a
Rock
/
Ground
-type Pokémon. Geodude will evolve into
Graveler
starting at Level 25, then into
Golem
when traded. Geodude evolutionary line has high Attack and very high Defense, but low Special Attack, Special Defense and Speed. It can learn good Rock-type and Ground-type moves, such as
Stone Edge
and
Earthquake
by leveling up, as well as
Rock Slide
through
TM80
. It can also launch suicide attacks with
Selfdestruct
and
Explosion
. However, it has two major weaknesses:
Water-type
and
Grass-type
attacks.
Psyduck
is a Water-type Pokémon that focuses on Special attacks. It evolves into
Golduck
at Level 33. If you decide to use this Pokémon, keep in mind that the only Special Water-type moves you'll get through levelling up are
Water Pulse
and
Hydro Pump
. It can use two different
Ice-type
attacks via TM, but all in all, this Pokémon's movepool is pretty limited. If you want to use a Water-type on your team, there are certainly other options in the Sinnoh region even if you didn't pick
Piplup
, though if you're a fan of the Psyduck line and are willing to put in the time and effort of first finding, and then catching this Pokémon, you can still make it do well in battle.

A colored background means that the Pokémon can be found in this location in the specified game. A white background with a colored letter means that the Pokémon cannot be found here.
The only new find is
Abra
, which is a
Psychic-type
Pokémon. Abra will struggle a lot at first (even more troublesome than Zubat) due to knowing only
Teleport
. However, Abra will be powerful if you evolve it into
Kadabra
starting from Level 16, and then into
Alakazam
by
trading it
. Kadabra and Alakazam are able to pick up
Psychic
,
Psyshock
and
Future Sight
by leveling up and
Dream Eater
through TM. It can also be taught a variety of coverage moves via TM. The Abra evolutionary line has high Special Attack and Speed, but low Defense. Abra is difficult to catch because it will always use
Teleport
unless you use
Taunt
, which
Chimchar
will learn at level 9 (be careful that Abra will
Struggle
then). If you didn't pick Chimchar, your best bet at this point is to throw a
Poké Ball
right away and hope to get lucky. If you are unable or too impatient to catch Abra, a woman in
Oreburgh City
will trade you one for a
Machop
.
To avoid wild Pokémon, you can use the
Repel
found on the north bank of the pond. In the future, you will be able to buy Repels from
Poké Marts
.
