On Thursdays, a tourist in the middle room upstairs will give your lead Pokémon a

Coumarine Gym
Coumarine Gym
The
Coumarine Gym
specializes in
Grass-type
Pokémon.
Fire
- and
Flying-type
attacks are the most effective, as are
Poison
,
Bug
, and
Ice
moves. Avoid using
Water
-,
Ground
-, and
Rock-type
Pokémon. The building contains a large central tree, on which the Gym Leader has constructed an obstacle course.
Climb the rope near the entrance, then swing right to battle Pokémon Ranger Chaise. Climb the nearby rope, swing left twice and climb up the next. Swing left and climb down the next rope. Go left to fight Pokémon Ranger Brooke, climb the nearby rope and head left. Climb up again and swing right twice to battle Pokémon Ranger Twiggy. Climb the rope to 6F, and swing right twice more to reach the Gym Leader.
Ramos
leads with his
Jumpluff
, a speedy Pokémon with a double-weakness to Ice attacks. Watch out for its
Acrobatics
, which doubles in power with no item to weigh it down.
Weepinbell
can be a nuisance due to its
Poison Powder
, but shouldn't be too difficult to take down. For Fire types, his
Gogoat
is the biggest threat; its
Bulldoze
inflicts double-damage and lowers the target's
Speed
.

With the battle over, Ramos awards you the
Plant Badge
, which ensures obedience from all Pokémon up to level 60 and enables the use of
Fly
in the field. He also hands out
TM86
(
Grass Knot
), which deals more damage to heavier targets, as a prize. Afterwards, the wooden door to the right opens, allowing you to quickly slide down through the tree to the exit.
Another Holo Clip
As you approach the south gate, you receive a Holo Clip from
Lysandre
. He is thrilled that you've learned to use
Mega Evolution
, and hopes that you use this power to help shape a better world.
Gate to Route 13
In the south gate, Sycamore's assistants
Sina
and
Dexio
are waiting for you. The two inform you that a problem at the
Power Plant
has closed the gate between
Route 13
and
Lumiose City
. They then upgrade your Pokédex with the Mountain Kalos listing, which encompasses the remaining eastern part of the region.
Route 13
Route 13
Route 13
, or Lumiose Badlands, links
Coumarine City
to
Lumiose City
. No plants can grow in this inhospitable area, making it the perfect location to host the
Power Plant
. Many Ground types tunnel beneath the red clay; the more aggressive ones will follow you as you explore. Perhaps their behavior is related to the problems at the Power Plant...

The

Defeating the two brings the Power Plant back online. Suddenly, two masked strangers calling themselves the Defenders of Kalos arrive to investigate, but you beat them to it. Impressed, they fully heal your party and give you a pair of
Full Restores
before leaving.
Outside this room, you will come across another entrance on the right. Speak to the worker and woman inside to obtain
TM43
(
Flame Charge
) and a
Magnet
. On the right side of the room you'll find a
Zap Plate
.
Also, talk to the man in a suit to obtain
Fresh Water
; before the plant is restored he will charge $300 for a bottle instead of the usual $200, but afterwards he sells them for a discounted $100 per bottle.
The Traveler
Outside the Lumiose gate, you meet a tall, mysterious man. He doesn't say much before heading into the city, but maybe you will meet him again...
On the right is a small path leading to cracked rock, break it and check the patch of ground off the side for a hidden Stardust. Break the next rock to find a Rare Candy.
