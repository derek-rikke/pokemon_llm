Pokémon League
Pokémon League
This is it, the
Pokémon League
! Inside this castle, you will meet some of the strongest Trainers in
Kalos
: the
Elite Four
, and the
Champion
who reigns over them. Make sure that your team is ready for anything, as once you begin, there's no turning back!
In addition to using TMs, consider revisiting the
Move Tutors
in
Snowbelle City
and
Route 21
to learn powerful attacks that will exploit your opponents' weaknesses. Each Elite Four member has two
Full Restores
to use, and the Champion has three, making it vital to have moves that will knock out their Pokémon before they can heal them. Outfit your party members with useful items, like a
Quick Claw
for a slower Pokémon, or a
Wide Lens
for one with inaccurate moves. Stock up on medicine, especially Full Restores and
Revives
.
Great Hall
Enter the castle and proceed down either hallway to the great hall. Here you meet
Malva
, one of the Elite Four and the group's
Fire-type
specialist. She suggests that you do your best, as you won't reach the Champion if you cannot survive against the others first. She mocks you as she returns to her chamber, saying that it should be a walk in the park for you, the "hero"/"heroine" who destroyed big, bad
Team Flare
.
Challengers are allowed to choose the order in which they battle the Elite Four, so take on the easiest opponents first. By doing this, your Pokémon will become slightly stronger before facing the more difficult opponents.
Blazing Chamber
Blazing Chamber
The northeast doorway leads to the
Blazing Chamber
. A ring of fire encircles the battlefield, which features a large pipe on either side. When you enter, each pipe spits out two small flames, then two large pillars of fire erupt and rise to the ceiling. The
Fire-type
specialist is resting on her throne, forcing you to come to her.
All of
Malva
's Pokémon are vulnerable to
Water
and
Rock
attacks, while three are also vulnerable to
Ground
moves. She opens with her
Pyroar
, a female with the
Rivalry
Ability.
Wild Charge
serves as a way to deal with
Water
Pokémon, and its signature move,
Noble Roar
, scares the target into lowering both its Attack and Special Attack stats. Her
Torkoal
has decent Attack and great Defense; using
Curse
raises these stats while sacrificing its already-low Speed.
Flame Wheel
receives a same-type attack bonus, while
Earthquake
and
Stone Edge
provide coverage.
Chandelure
has a great Special Attack rating, and puts it to use with
Flamethrower
and
Shadow Ball
; it can also cause problems with
Confuse Ray
. Her
Talonflame
has great Speed, which pairs well with its powerful
Brave Bird
and
Flare Blitz
moves. Don't let it linger on, as
Flail
grows stronger when its health wears thin. Both Chandelure and Talonflame have the
Flame Body
Ability, so opt for special moves to avoid the chance of getting
Burned
.

Flood Chamber
Flood Chamber
The southeast doorway leads to the
Flood Chamber
. Each side of the battlefield features a hollow, screw-shaped pillar with a chain that reaches up to the ceiling. As you enter, the pillars briefly spin upwards, and the chains are pulled down through them. A large volume of water then spouts from these pillars, while water also begins cascading down the walls. This temporarily floods the room before you can approach this opponent.
Siebold
is the Elite Four's
Water-type
specialist. Each one of his Pokémon is vulnerable to
Electric-type
attacks, and most are afraid of
Grass
moves, as well. He opens with his
Clawitzer
, which uses several pulse moves to take advantage of its
Mega Launcher
Ability.
Gyarados
can deal serious damage due to its high Attack coupled with strong physical moves. To make things worse,
Dragon Dance
can raise its already-high Attack and Speed, while
Earthquake
is used to deal with Electric-type opponents. His
Starmie
knows
Surf
and
Psychic
, two strong moves that both receive a same-type attack bonus. It can also raise his team's Special Defense for five turns with
Light Screen
. Each of
Barbaracle
's moves fall under the physical category, so each receives a power boost due to its
Tough Claws
Ability.
Cross Chop
and
Stone Edge
have high critical-hit rates, and
Razor Shell
attack may lower the target's Defense, making it an even bigger threat.

Ironworks Chamber
Ironworks Chamber
The northwest doorway leads to the
Ironworks Chamber
. As you enter, two giant blades descend from the ceiling into two slots on the floor. They turn 90 degrees, causing a flash of green light to climb the wall before it sinks into the floor. The blades turn another 90 degrees and a circular fence rises around the arena, after which the iron-clad Trainer leaves his throne to meet you.
Wikstrom
is the Elite Four's
Steel-type
specialist. Three of his Pokémon are vulnerable to
Fire
attacks, while the fourth is especially vulnerable to
Fighting
and
Ground
moves. He leads with his
Klefki
, whose damaging moves include
Dazzling Gleam
and
Flash Cannon
, which both receive a
same-type attack bonus
. His
Probopass
has great defenses, and its
Sturdy
Ability prevents a one-hit knockout. While Fire-type Pokémon can attack most of his team with impunity, Probopass puts a stop to this with its
Earth Power
and
Power Gem
attacks. A high attack rating and strong moves make
Scizor
a major threat already, but its priority move,
Bullet Punch
, receives a power boost from its
Technician
Ability. His Aegislash enters the battle in Shield Forme, which boasts
superior defenses
but low offenses. When attacking, its
signature Ability
shifts it to Blade Forme, and becomes an
offensive threat
. It reverts to Shield Forme by using its signature move,
King's Shield
; this move protects it from most damaging moves and lowers the Attack of any attacker that makes direct contact.

Dragonmark Chamber
Dragonmark Chamber
The southwest doorway leads to the
Dragonmark Chamber
. When you enter, the room is filled with a blue-purple mist which quickly clears. Two large structures shaped like a dragon's wings open wide, revealing a cover shaped like a dragon's head. This cover then lifts up, revealing your opponent. Small blue flames flicker briefly atop each of the two pipes before incense begins wafting into the room.
Drasna
is the Elite Four's
Dragon-type
specialist. All four of her Pokémon are vulnerable to
Ice
attacks. They are all vulnerable to Dragon attacks as well, but avoid using Dragon Pokémon against her. She leads with
Dragalge
, a
Poison
/
Dragon
Pokémon with strong coverage moves in the form of
Surf
and
Thunderbolt
. As a Poison type, it is the only one of her team not susceptible to
Fairy
attacks. Her
Druddigon
is all about payback;
Revenge
doubles in power if the user was injured in the same turn, and
Retaliate
's power is doubled if a teammate fainted in the previous turn.
Altaria
battles more defensively, as
Cotton Guard
drastically raises its Defense, and
Sing
can lull the target to
sleep
. Its
Moonblast
attack helps to deal with opposing dragons. The biggest threat is her
Noivern
, a speedy
Flying
/
Dragon
Pokémon.
Air Slash
may cause the target to
flinch
,
Super Fang
cuts the target's remaining health in half, and
Flamethrower
lets it account for a
Steel-type
opponent that would resist its other moves.

Radiant Chamber
Radiant Chamber
Upon defeating the final member of the Elite Four, the large door in the great hall opens. The hallway beyond shines with white marble and gold trim, and a ray of shimmering sunlight falls on the platform. Ride the elevator to the final chamber, a massive, sunlit room with long, transparent curtains fluttering in the breeze. The floor is covered by colorful, abstract designs that represent the many Pokémon types. It is here that the Champion,
Diantha
, waits to greet you.
Diantha uses a diverse team, though many of her Pokémon share a weakness to
Ice
,
Steel
, and
Fairy
moves. She leads with her
Hawlucha
, a speedy
Fighting
/
Flying
-type Pokémon. Its signature move,
Flying Press
, is considered both a Fighting- and Flying-type attack,
X-Scissor
is used to deal with
Psychic-type
opponents, and
Poison Jab
accounts for Fairy-type targets.
Tyrantrum
has high Attack and Defense ratings, and is Diantha's best physical attacker. Its
Head Smash
can cause massive damage, but deals serious recoil damage to the user as well.
Earthquake
provides coverage and
Crunch
's power is boosted due to its
Strong Jaw
Ability. Her
Aurorus
is more specially-inclined; it plays its part by using
Reflect
and
Light Screen
to boost its team's defenses. When it does attack, its high-powered
Blizzard
and
Thunder
moves help compensate for its mediocre Special Attack.
Gourgeist
's signature move,
Trick-or-Treat
, adds a second (or third) type onto its target, the
Ghost
type. It can then use the priority move
Shadow Sneak
or the two-turn
Phantom Force
to deal super-effective damage. Her
Goodra
boasts great Special Defense, and
Sap Sipper
leaves it immune to
Grass
moves like
Leech Seed
. In addition, the types of moves it uses are varied enough to provide excellent coverage. Diantha's final Pokémon is
Gardevoir
, a powerful special attacker. She quickly induces Mega Evolution, allowing it to become the even more powerful Mega Gardevoir. Its moves are strong and accurate, and combined achieve great coverage.
Steel-type
Pokémon are probably best to oppose it, as they resist
Moonblast
and
Psychic
, and neither
Shadow Ball
or
Thunderbolt
are much of a threat to them.

Hall of Fame
After seeing your strength in battle,
Diantha
realizes why
Professor Sycamore
was concerned about preparing
Lumiose City
for the new
Champion
. The two of you take the elevator up to the final room, where you and your Pokémon are recorded in
Kalos
'
Hall of Fame
for all eternity.
Lumiose City
A few days later, large crowds gather in
Lumiose City
to cheer for
the
five
defenders
of
Kalos
and its new Champion. The five friends proceed to the stage where Professor Sycamore and
his
assistants
are waiting. Sycamore presents you with the
Honor of Kalos
, a medal shaped like its namesake region, as thanks for defeating
Team Flare
. The festivities are interrupted soon after, when
AZ
appears and asks you to battle him. He wants to know what a Trainer is, and it's up to you to enlighten him.

He thanks you for the battle and expresses his new-found sense of freedom—free from sorrow, and the part of him that built the ultimate weapon. Just then, he notices something in the sky. It's his long-lost
Floette
, floating down to reunite with its Trainer. As the gentle giant falls to his knees, Sycamore says that Floette was waiting all this time for AZ to return to the man it once knew. A
Fletchling
happily chirps overhead, and the credits begin to roll...
