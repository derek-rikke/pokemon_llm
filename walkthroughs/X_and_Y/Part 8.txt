Shauna catches up to you just inside the city. She asks if you heard who saved the
Power Plant
, but it makes no difference what you tell her. After that, she directs you to Prism Tower to watch its relighting.
Centrico Plaza
Outside the tower, you and Shauna meet the local Gym Leader,
Clemont
, and his younger sister,
Bonnie
. Clemont activates the lighting system and the tower begins to shine. The two siblings head inside, leaving you free to challenge the Gym.
Lumiose Gym
Lumiose Gym
The
Lumiose Gym
specializes in
Electric-type
Pokémon. Use
Ground
attacks to deal serious damage, and avoid using
Water
- and
Flying-type
Pokémon. Take the elevator to the second floor to meet Bonnie, who informs you that you need to successfully answer her questions to advance. She will display a Pokémon's silhouette, and you must guess its name. To make a selection, you must battle the Trainer who blocks the elevator with the corresponding number. Each wrong answer forces you to battle an additional Trainer, so you may face anywhere from four to twelve opponents before reaching the Gym Leader on 6F. The correct order is #3 (
Pikachu
), #1 (
Fletchling
), #3 (
Panpour
), and #2 (
Vivillon
).
Clemont
leads with his
Emolga
, an
Electric
/
Flying
Pokémon that only fears
Rock
and
Ice
moves. Its
Volt Switch
move lets it hit and run, so be careful. His
Magneton
can be a hassle due to its
Sturdy
Ability, and its
Mirror Shot
allows it to harass Rock types. Use
Fighting
or
Fire
attacks to take it down.
Heliolisk
is vulnerable only to Ground and Fighting moves, but its
Grass Knot
can trip up any Ground types looking to exploit its weakness.

After the battle, Clemont awards you the
Voltage Badge
, which ensures obedience of all Pokémon up to level 70. He also throws in
TM24
(
Thunderbolt
) as a prize.
Holo Clip
When you step outside, you receive a Holo Clip from
Sycamore
. He asks that you meet him in
Lysandre Café
, located northwest of the Gym between Magenta Plaza and Autumnal Avenue.
Lysandre Café
Inside, you find
Professor Sycamore
meeting with
Lysandre
. The two briefly discuss
Mega Evolution
before Lysandre details more about his passion for beauty. He also reveals that he is related to a powerful king who ruled the region 3,000 years ago. The professor thinks that Lysandre is a great man, and Lysandre hands you a
King's Rock
before leaving.
Holo Clip
Trevor contacts you when you leave the café, and informs you that the group plans to meet up on
Route 14
.
You can leave at any time, but don't forget to check out the rest of the city!
North Boulevard
Office Buildings
The first office building stands near the
Route 13
gate. There is nothing of interest here, as a photo shoot takes up most of the lobby.
A second office building is located west of the
Route 14
gate. On 2F, a ghost girl appears behind you. She whispers,
"No, you're not the one..."
, before disappearing. 3F holds a Fighting Dojo, where a Waitress hands out an
Expert Belt
and a Battle Girl gives out a
Protein
.
A third building can be found to the east of Hotel Richissime. The Scientist on 1F is looking for a Pokémon with either the
Aroma Veil
,
Flower Veil
, or
Sweet Veil
Abilities; show her one to earn a
Star Piece
. On 4F, talk to the little girl for a
Prism Scale
.
Café Triste
Café Triste can be found to the northeast of the Route 13 gate. There are few customers here, and even once you max your style, it merely gains a few more.
Galette Stand
The Galette Stand is located in the northwest, across the street from Autumnal Avenue. The shop offers
Lumiose Galettes
for
$
100 (
$
80 for more stylish patrons), but these are only available for one hour at a time. They may be purchased beginning at 3am, 9am, 3pm, and 9pm. Once per day, you will also receive a free
Moomoo Milk
. Those with maximum style may purchase them at any time.
Lumiose Museum
The
Lumiose Museum
can be found across the street from the North Pokémon Center. Entrance is free, but audio guides are available for
$
200 (or free, for those stylish enough). This allows you to check the box near a painting for a detailed explanation. Speak to the Ace Trainer on 1F to receive
TM82
(
Dragon Tail
).
Hotel Richissime
Hotel Richissime
is a luxury hotel, across the street from Hibernal Avenue. Talk to
Mr. Bonding
on 1F to receive the
Bargain Power
O-Power. The man behind the desk will allow you to stay the night, healing your Pokémon in the process, for
$
100,000. The woman next to him offers to hire you for some part-time work, and gives three tasks per day. Rewards range from
$
2,000 to
$
650 initially, and
$
50,000 to
$
950 for the most difficult jobs.
Room service
: Receive a guest's order and repeat it correctly to the concierge, Stew, by combining four phrase options. Initially, you receive only one order, but this will increase to four.
Making beds
: Go to a certain floor to meet the attendant, Ward. Quickly change the sheets of the bed in each of the four rooms while avoiding delays from the obstacles in the hallways. The time limit begins at 75 seconds initially, and eventually drops to 40 seconds.
Lost and found
: A maid, Esse, receives a call from a guest who needs help finding an item on the floor. These items are fragile, and must not be stepped on. At first, you only need to find one item in one room, and it is still useable if stepped on once. Later, four items must be found across the entire floor, and stepping on any of them once is enough to fail the task.
Also, speak to the girl singing in the bathroom on 5F to receive
TM49
(
Echoed Voice
).
Roller Skater
Near Hotel Richissime is a Roller Skater who teaches a special move, the backflip. To do this, accelerate while jumping off a ledge.
Café Ultimo
Café Ultimo stands at the end of Hibernal Avenue. This is a favorite spot for
Super Training
fans. Talk to the woman near the counter with a Supremely Trained Pokémon in your party to receive a
Training Ribbon
.
Café Action!
Down the street from Café Ultimo is Café Action! This café is all about Trainer PR videos, and you can speak to the man near the counter to unlock three new phrases to use in these videos. Visit every day to unlock them all!
Battle Institute
The
Battle Institute
stands in the east, next to the
Route 16
gate. This facility lets you put your battle skills to the ultimate test, but is only open to those who have become the Champion.
Lumiose Station
Lumiose Station is located next door to the Battle Institute. This station is a major hub, connecting Lumiose with other cities across the region. However, the high-speed trains are not running at the moment.
Café Bataille
Across the street is Café Bataille, which attracts those who are serious about battling. Visitors may find useful advice by speaking to the four Black Belts along the back wall.
Autumnal Avenue
Poké Ball Boutique
The Poké Ball Boutique offers specialty Poké Balls. This is the only location where Premier Balls and Luxury Balls may be purchased individually.

The quickest and easiest way to become more stylish is buying Premier Balls one at a time. After buying over 100 of these, visit the Ore Emporium on Vernal Avenue; if the man selling Mega Stones has lowered his price to
$
10,000, then your style is maxed out!
Talk to the little girl and answer
Yes
to her question. She rewards you with a random item, either three
Heal Balls
or one
Luxury Ball
. This can be done once per day.
Café Pokémon-Amie
Café Pokémon-Amie stands across the street, near Lysandre Café. The place is a favorite of
Pokémon-Amie
fans, though there is little of interest here.
Restaurant Le Yeah
Restaurant Le Yeah is a two-star restaurant located next door to the Poké Ball Boutique. It costs
$
15,000 to enter and participate in
Triple
and
Rotation Battles
. The perfect reward is 20

.
Juice Shoppe
The
Juice Shoppe
can be found next door to Restaurant Le Yeah. This specialty shop offers juices made from
Berries
. The man on the left sells pre-made drinks that have a variety of effects, from increasing level to happiness. The lady on the right will create a custom-blend juice by mixing two Berries; different-colored Berries yield different results. These juices cannot be kept, and must be fed to a party Pokémon immediately. Juice may be bought/blended once per day.

Jaune Alley
Trevor's House
The single apartment here happens to belong to Trevor's family. Talk to his Ace Trainer sister to learn that their parents left to train their Pokémon while traveling the world. A female Scientist here is interested in seeing a Pokémon with the
Eerie Impulse
move; show her one to get a

There's not much going on in Café Gallant. The only notable thing is that the employees are all male. It is apparently a popular café among the women of Kalos.
Lumiose Press
Lumiose Press is located next door to the Loto-ID Center. Speak to
Viola
's sister,
Alexa
