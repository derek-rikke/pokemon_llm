Inverse Battle house
Visit the house on the hill past the bridge to meet a Psychic who has invented a new type of battle, the
Inverse Battle
. In these unusual battles, the type chart is completely reversed. Moves that would normally be super-effective against their target are considered not very effective, and vice versa. For example, this means that
Fire
moves deal greater damage to
Water
Pokémon, and
Dragon-type
attacks can now hit
Fairy
Pokémon. You can have an Inverse Battle against Psychic Inver once per day, with him using a random selection of three Pokémon from
a wide list of possibilities
in each battle. If you win, he rewards you with a
Rare Candy
,
Berry
, or
Evolution stone
. If none of your Pokémon faint during battle,
he rewards you
with three of the same item.
Terminus Cave
The abandoned coal mine near the Inverse Battle house is known as
Terminus Cave
. It is possible to explore most of the cave at this point, but an Ace Trainer prevents anyone from reaching the deepest chamber. Professor Sycamore is waiting for you in
Couriway Town
, and there is surely some catching up to do after the events in
Geosenge Town
, so it may be best to hurry along for now. Perhaps you will return someday to investigate the rumors of a monster lurking in its dark tunnels...
Couriway Town
Couriway Town
The rushing roar of
Couriway Town
's giant waterfall is surprisingly soothing. The railway brings people from across the region to see the huge, majestic falls. Even though you're only passing through, don't let that stop you from taking a moment to enjoy the awesome spectacle of nature.

appears. He apologizes for not realizing the errors of
Lysandre

Talk with the Townspeople
Speaking with the residents is both informative and profitable, so be sure to visit with everyone!
Climb the stairway to Couriway Station and talk to the Madame to receive
TM89
(
U-turn
).
Visit the house near the Pokémon Center. The Schoolgirl inside wants to see a Pokémon with
Nuzzle
. Show her a Pokémon, like
Pikachu
or
Dedenne
, that knows this move to get a
Revive
.
Stop by the house south of the bridge and speak to the Beauty inside. She wants to see how well you know your first Pokémon, and quizzes you on its height and weight. Answer correctly to obtain either a
Miracle Seed
,
Charcoal
, or
Mystic Water
.
Couriway Hotel
Couriway Hotel is located on the south side of town. Talk to the girl in the lobby for another quizzical question; answer correctly to obtain
TM55
(
Scald
).
Mr. Bonding
can be found upstairs, waiting to meet you again. This time, he grants you the
Stealth Power
O-Power, which decreases the chance of encountering wild Pokémon.
On Fridays, there is a woman upstairs who will give a
Relax Ribbon
to your lead Pokémon.
Route 19
Route 19
Route 19
, or Grande Vallée Way, consists of a large valley between
Couriway Town
in the northeast and
Snowbelle City
in the southwest. Many flowers line the upper path, while the lower path leads to a less-inviting swampy basin. The route's most impressive landmark is the long bridge that spans the swampy gorge.
