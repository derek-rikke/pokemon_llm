Catching a Pokémon
Serena/Calem and Shauna are a few steps ahead, waiting near the second grass patch. Your neighbor plans to demonstrate how to catch a Pokémon, and walks into the tall grass to find one. A wild
Bunnelby
attacks, and the Trainer uses her/his
Fletchling
to weaken the animal before throwing a Poké Ball. Afterwards, she/he gives the others ten
Poké Balls
each before leaving to the north. Be sure to battle many Pokémon; not only does a Trainer's Pokémon earn
experience
by defeating others, it also earns experience by helping to catch Pokémon!
Santalune Forest
Santalune Forest
The lush
Santalune Forest
is situated between
Route 2
and
Route 3
. The area is filled with tall grass, making it a great place for catching Pokémon. But this has also attracted several Pokémon Trainers who are eager to test their skills!

The Group Returns
Shauna catches up to you just inside the entrance, and asks to tag along. She offers to heal your Pokémon at any time, making her an ideal traveling companion. Go west to collect an
Antidote
and a
Potion
, then pick up a second Potion near the entrance. Head northeast to find the rest of the group; Trevor is searching for wild Pokémon, while Tierno battles a Youngster. Just north of them, Shauna excitedly notices an item in the tall grass—a
Paralyze Heal
, which she hands over to you. Battle Youngster Joey and continue westward to find Serena/Calem, who hands over a
Poké Ball
. Turn south to battle Lass Anna, then fight Lass Lise to reach a second Poké Ball. Go west for a third
Potion
, then head north. The rest of the group catches up, and the five Trainers leave the forest together.
Route 3
Route 3
Route 3
, or Ouvert Way, is a short path that links

and

. Continue the hunt for new Pokémon before heading into town!

The Group Departs
After leaving the forest, everyone gathers for a quick meeting. Trevor and Tierno make plans to catch more Pokémon, but Serena/Calem is more interested in challenging the
Gym Leader
of the nearby city. Before the meeting ends, she/he gives each person an
Adventure Rules
handbook that lists ten tips every Pokémon Trainer should know.
Santalune City
Santalune City
Santalune City
is a bustling hub of Pokémon Trainer activity. The city is home to the first Pokémon Center that young Trainers will come across, as well as the Trainers' School and the
Santalune Gym
.
Route 22
stretches out to the east, while
Route 4
lies to the north.

Pokémon Center
Upon entering the building with the red door, Tierno shows up to explain all about
Pokémon Centers
. These hospitals restore a Trainer's Pokémon to full health and eliminate any status ailments that may afflict them. The
PC
can be used to organize Pokémon, and the
Poké Mart
on the right side sells various items like Potions and Poké Balls. The left side of the building is occupied by a changing room, where Trainers can change their outfit. Mom packed you a change of clothes, but other accessories may be purchased at the boutiques scattered across the region.
Santalune Boutique
The local boutique can be found just east of the Pokémon Center. This shop offers several hats and button accessories for sale. Like the other boutiques, the selection changes daily.
Time for a Trade
In the house to the west of the fountain, a Hiker named Cliff is looking to trade Pokémon. He offers his
Farfetch'd
, nicknamed Quacklin', in exchange for a
Bunnelby
. Farfetch'd are quite rare, and this one even knows
Aerial Ace
, a perfect move to use at the local Gym.
Trainers' School
The Trainers' School is located to the north of the fountain. Inside, the teacher hands out three
X Attacks
and three
X Defenses
. The whiteboard at the front of the room lists several status ailments that can affect a Pokémon.
Ailment
Effect(s)
BURNED
Attack
drops to 50%; inflicts damage equal to 1/8 of maximum
HP
every turn.
Fire-type
Pokémon are immune to this condition.
FROZEN
Cannot move until thawed, 20% chance per turn.
Ice-type
Pokémon are immune to this condition.
PARALYZE
Speed
drops to 25%; cannot attack a quarter of the time.
Electric-type
Pokémon are immune to this condition.
POISONED
Inflicts damage equal to 1/8 of maximum
HP
every turn.
Poison-type
Pokémon cannot be Poisoned or Badly Poisoned.
ASLEEP
Cannot move for one to three turns.
Rinka the Roller Skater
The Gym is blocked off by Rinka, the Roller Skater that nearly collided with you on
Route 3
. She cannot believe that you do not own a pair of
Roller Skates
, and offers to hand over a pair if she is defeated in battle. These Roller Skates, which allow faster travel than the Running Shoes, can be used by moving the Circle Pad. They also allow movement that is not restricted to the eight-directional grid. To kick them off, move the character with the D-Pad.
Santalune Gym
Santalune Gym
The
Santalune Gym
specializes in
Bug-type
Pokémon, which are vulnerable to
Fire
-,
Flying
-, and
Rock-type
moves. The
Grass-type
Chespin
may struggle here, especially if it has not learned
Rollout
, a Rock attack. Good Pokémon to bring with you on your gym challenge are the
Fire-type
Pansear
which learns
Incinerate
at level 10 and is found back in Santalune Forest,
Fletchling
which learns a
Flying
move at level 10 and can be found almost everywhere you've already been,
Dunsparce
from Route 3 which learns
Rock-type
move
Rollout
at level 3, and/or the
Fire-type
Litleo
on Route 22. The Gym Leader is a professional photographer, and the ground-floor gallery displays images of
Metapod
and
Butterfree
on the rear wall. A pole leads down to the basement, to the center of a giant spider web. Wider parts of the web can be traveled on, while the path to the Gym Leader is marked by dewdrops.
Viola
's
Surskit
takes neutral damage from Fire moves, and can temporarily weaken all Fire attacks with
Water Sport
. Her
Vivillon
's
Infestation
prevents the target from switching, and inflicts damage for several turns after use. The traded
Farfetch'd
can be a big help with its
Aerial Ace
, and the secondary types of Viola's Pokémon share a weakness to
Electric-type
attacks.

Defeated, Viola awards you the
Bug Badge
, which ensures obedience from all Pokémon up to level 30. She also hands over
TM83
(
Infestation
) as a prize. To exit the Gym, climb the stairs behind the Gym Leader to re-emerge on the ground floor from behind her Butterfree portrait.
The Journalist
At the exit to Route 4, you are stopped by a woman who introduces herself as
Alexa
, a journalist and older sister to
Viola
. She seems impressed that a young Trainer managed to defeat her sister, and suggests visiting her at the publishing house in
Lumiose City
. Before leaving, she hands over the
Exp. Share
, an item that distributes experience points to all party members, even those that did not battle. This can be turned off and on at any time.
Route 4
Route 4
Route 4
, or Parterre Way, stretches north from
Santalune City
to
Lumiose City
. Its perfectly executed gardens are a special point of pride, and the plaza surrounding Perle Fountain is a favorite spot for Roller Skaters. There is no tall grass here, but the colorful flower patches hide their own Pokémon.

At the route's north end, two people are standing outside the gate to

Flabébé
, explaining that it is one of the newly discovered
Fairy-type
Pokémon. They work for
Professor Sycamore
, and have been researching this new type by battling Fairy Pokémon against other types at the professor's request. They introduce themselves as Sina and Dexio, then offer to lead the way to Sycamore's lab in the big city. Inside the gate, Dexio asks about the bond you have with your starter Pokémon before handing over
TM27
(
