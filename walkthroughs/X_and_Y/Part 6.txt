Rewards from the Residents
Visit the first house to the west of the Pokémon Center and speak to the elderly woman inside. Show her a
happy
Pokémon to receive a
Soothe Bell
, which boosts friendship at a faster-than-normal rate when held.
In the next house to the west, a Rising Star will give your lead Pokémon a
Footprint Ribbon
if it has grown at least 30 levels since you received it. In the same building, a girl asks for help retrieving some luggage; lend her a
Flying
- or
Psychic-type
Pokémon to earn five
Stardusts
.
There is a Scientist in the house to the east of the Pokémon Center. If you have seen at least 40 kinds of Pokémon from the Coastal Kalos Pokédex, he rewards you with an
Eviolite
. When held, this item gives a 50% boost to both the Defense and Special Defense of a Pokémon that can still evolve.
Hit the Beach!
Tierno and Trevor catch up to you on the way northward. Trevor wants to compare Pokédexes again, and both are excited to meet the Mega Evolution guru. They believe that he can be found in the
Tower of Mastery
on the city's north side.
Continue north to the beach, and Tierno reappears. He received an
Intriguing Stone
from a wandering stone collector for showing off his dance moves, and he wants you to have it. He happily hands it over, exclaiming that it might be a Mega Stone.

A large
Lucario
statue greets all who enter the
Tower of Mastery
. Step inside the room beneath it to meet
Korrina
and the guru, who happens to be her grandfather. Tierno and Trevor enter soon afterwards. The guru asks if it was you who found the
Intriguing Stone
, but dismisses it as an ordinary rock, not a Mega Stone. A commotion outside leads the group to check it out, but it's just Serena/Calem and Shauna. After a lengthy discussion about evolution and
Mega Evolution
, the guru informs the group that he has only one
Mega Ring
, which is required to activate the Mega Stones. Tierno, Shauna, and Trevor quickly decline, leaving you and Serena/Calem. The other Trainer suggests battling to determine who receives the Mega Ring, and uses her/his level 28
Meowstic
, level 28
Absol
, and second-stage starter Pokémon at level 30. Earning the Mega Ring is not so simple, though; to officially prove yourself, you must defeat Korrina at the Gym.

Shalour Gym
Shalour Gym
The
Shalour Gym
specializes in
Fighting-type
Pokémon. Use
Flying
-,
Psychic
-, or
Fairy-type
moves to deal serious damage, and avoid using
Normal
-,
Rock
-,
Steel
-,
Ice
-, and
Dark-type
Pokémon. The Gym is modeled as a large skate park, and the four Roller Skaters are constantly on the move. Defeating each one raises a section of rail; when all four are defeated, the path to the Gym Leader is complete.
You have battled
Korrina
before, but she lets her two
Lucario
sit this one out. Her
Mienfoo
tends to start off with
Fake Out
, and can prove deadly with
Power-Up Punch
. As an evolved Pokémon, her
Machoke
can deal even more damage, and also has
Rock Tomb
to counter Flying Pokémon. The speediest of the bunch, her
Hawlucha
is also vulnerable to
Electric
- and
Ice-type
attacks, and its signature
Flying Press
move is treated as both a Fighting- and Flying-type move simultaneously.

Defeated, Korrina awards you the
Rumble Badge
, which ensures obedience from all Pokémon up to level 50, and enables the use of
Surf
in the field. She also hands out
TM98
(
Power-Up Punch
) as a prize. She then asks for a favor: meet her in the
Tower of Mastery
for another battle, as equals who can both use
Mega Evolution
!
Tower of Mastery
Inside, the guru tells you that
Korrina
, the Mega Evolution successor, is waiting at the top of the tower. Talk to everyone on the way up to learn the history of Mega Evolution. On 2F, a girl reveals the guru's real name: Gurkinn! On 4F, an Ace Trainer hands out
TM47
(
Low Sweep
). The path ends on 5F, which leads out onto a balcony with
Korrina
and her two
Lucario
. She gives you the
Mega Ring
, a bracelet which now enables you to Mega Evolve certain Pokémon during battle! After a little more dialogue, one Lucario crosses the balcony, wanting to join you in battle. Both Pokémon are holding Mega Stones, so use Mega Evolution right away and unleash
Power-Up Punch
to easily defeat the other.

Afterwards, Korrina suggests taking that Lucario along on the journey. Leave the tower behind, and stop by the Pokémon Center to prepare for
Route 12
.
A Gift
Serena/Calem catches up to you near the east gate and hands over
HM03
(
Surf
). In battle, Surf is a strong
Water-type
move that hits nearby Pokémon. In the field, it enables water-bound travel.
