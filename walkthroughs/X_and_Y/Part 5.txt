Sina and Dexio
A short distance from
Connecting Cave
, you are approached by Sina and Dexio. They upgrade your Pokédex with the Coastal Kalos listing, which encompasses the Pokémon found in the western third of the region. Then the two disappear as soon as they arrive.
Stepping Stones
To the south, a muddy pit is located just outside
Ambrette Town
. This forces travelers to jump from one stepping stone to another in order to cross it. Be sure to collect the
Leaf Stone
to the east!
Try a Sky Battle
Cross the muddy pit from the north side, and land on one of the eastern stones. This causes you to be challenged by Howe, a
Sky Trainer
. Trainers of this class only participate in
Sky Battles
, an optional battle format where only
Flying
or
Levitating
Pokémon are eligible.
Ambrette Town
Ambrette Town
Ambrette
is a dusty little town situated between
Route 8
and
Route 9
. The town is known for its Aquarium and its Fossil Lab, where Pokémon
Fossils
are studied and restored.

Meet up with Serena/Calem
Serena/Calem appears when you reach the stairway leading down into Ambrette. She/He suggests checking out the Fossil Lab, as the Scientists there may know something about the mysterious
Mega Stones
.
A Smashing Good Time
Speak to the girl near the Pokémon Center to receive
TM94
(
Rock Smash
). In the field, it allows a Pokémon to break apart small, cracked rocks. Doing so may reveal items or even certain Pokémon.
Trading Time
The Punk Guy outside the Fossil Lab is looking to trade—items, not Pokémon. He offers a
Dive Ball
in exchange for a
Poké Ball
. A Dive Ball acts like a normal Poké Ball, but is more effective against Pokémon found by
Surfing
or
Fishing
. This trade can be done once per day.
Fossil Lab
Serena/Calem is anxious to visit the Fossil Lab, but the Scientists here know little about the
Mega Stones
. However, they hint that their field assistant, on a dig site in
Glittering Cave
to the east, may know more.
A Request
Visit the blue-roofed house and speak to the female Ace Trainer inside. She asks to see a Pokémon with a Speed of a certain value or higher. Fulfill her request to receive a
Health Wing
. This can be done once per day.
Hotel Ambrette
Hotel Ambrette stands on the smaller southern cliff. Speak to the girl in the lobby to receive
TM96
(
Nature Power
). Nature Power becomes
a different move
based on the battle's location.
Mr. Bonding
can be found on the second floor, where he enables the
Sp. Def. Power
.
On Mondays, speaking to a traveler on the second floor will result in an
Alert Ribbon
.

Route 9

. While mounted, press the
A Button

to dismount.
Glittering Cave
Glittering Cave
The deep, dark

The outer tunnels are very dark, and the path is sometimes blocked by darker shadows that hide wild Pokémon. To reach the basement, go straight ahead at every junction. When in doubt, look for the green crystals that light the way. The first junction leads to a dead-end; the second, to a
Hard Stone
; and the third, to
TM65
(
Shadow Claw
).
B1F
Meet Team Flare
The inner tunnels are easier to navigate. Several members of
Team Flare
, a stylish but snobby group, are searching the area for Fossils. They do not take kindly to your presence, so be ready to battle!
Ancient Treasures
There are several
cracked rocks
scattered around the area. These may hide treasures like
Hard Stones
,
Revives
, or even Pokémon. Even the occasional
Old Amber
may appear; when restored, the material inside this ancient tree sap becomes the
Rock
/
Flying
Aerodactyl
. Return later after defeating the Elite Four, and other Fossil varieties may also appear.
Tag Team
Near the end of the cave, a pair of Team Flare Grunts block the path. Serena/Calem arrives just in time and offers to help take them on. Join up with her/his
Espurr
,
Absol
, and second-stage starter Pokémon to clear out these feisty fashionistas.
Locate the Assistant
The Fossil Lab assistant is conducting his research at the very end of the cave. Speak to him, and he offers one of the two Fossils he just found. The
Jaw Fossil
will become the
Rock
/
Dragon
Tyrunt
, while the
Sail Fossil
will become the
Rock
/
Ice
Amaura
. Afterwards, you can use the nearby
Escape Rope
to warp to the entrance, and trek back to
Ambrette Town
.
Ambrette Town
Fossil Lab
Speak to the assistant who now stands at the counter to restore any new Fossils.
Tyrunt
hits hard with biting moves due to its
Strong Jaw
Ability, while
Amaura
's
Refrigerate
Ability treats its
Normal-type
moves as
Ice-type
moves. All Pokémon obtained this way will appear at level 20. On the way out, talk to one of the workers to receive a Mega Stone, the
Aerodactylite
.
Ambrette Aquarium
The Ambrette Aquarium is a multi-level building on the west side of town. Go downstairs and talk to the Fisherman near the golden
Magikarp
statue to receive an
Old Rod
. This low-end fishing rod can hook Pokémon from any body of water, so be sure to try it out everywhere!

Time for a Trade
Inside the Pokémon Center, an Ace Trainer named Farris would like to trade. He offers his

Luvdisc
. Luvdisc are common in these waters, and Steelix can be very effective at the
Cyllage Gym
.
Cycle Shop
The Cycle Shop stands just east of the Pokémon Center. Answer the owner's question to receive a choice of either a green or yellow
Bicycle
!
Poké-Massage
Next door to the Pokémon Center, a girl offers to give one of your Pokémon a massage, free of charge. This increases the Pokémon's
happiness
, which is important for
certain
moves
and
evolutions
.
Pop Quiz
Visit the house to the west of the Boutique to take a quiz. The girl asks which
Berry
cures confusion, and which
move
causes it. Answer correctly to win three
Persim Berries
.
Hotel Cyllage
Head upstairs and talk to the Maid in the west room to get a
Destiny Knot
.
Mr. Bonding
can be found in the east room, where he enables the new
Prize Money Power
.
Collect an HM
Follow the paved road up the cliffside to meet
Grant
, the local Gym Leader, near the first bend. A Bicycle race just ended, but since you missed it, Grant hands over
HM04
(
Strength
) as a consolation prize. In the field, this lets Pokémon move large boulders, but it cannot be used without the local Gym badge.
Cyllage Gym
Cyllage Gym
The
Cyllage Gym
specializes in
Rock-type
Pokémon. Use
Fighting
,
Ground
, and
Steel
attacks to deal serious damage, and avoid using
Fire
-,
Flying
-, and
Bug-type
Pokémon.
Grass
and
Water
moves are also effective, but secondary types make things more complicated. Scale the rock walls, climbing ever higher to reach the Gym Leader at the summit.
Grant
's
Amaura
can hinder its foe with
Thunder Wave
, and can hit hard with its
Refrigerated
Take Down
. Due to its dual weakness, even weak Fighting moves like
Rock Smash
can deal major damage to it.
Tyrunt
's
Bite
gets a boost from its
Strong Jaw
Ability, and
Rock Tomb
can lower the foe's Speed. Its secondary type leaves it vulnerable to
Dragon
- and
Fairy-type
moves.
