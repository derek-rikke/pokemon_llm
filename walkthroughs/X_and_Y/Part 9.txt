Scary House
As you reach the route's north end, Shauna appears and leads you to the isolated building where Tierno and Trevor are waiting. After mustering the courage to enter, they find an unusual man who tells a spooky story. The man asks for a tip, and whether you pay or not, the friends hurry outside, eager to reach
Laverre City
.
Laverre City
Laverre City
The small
Laverre City
features quaint homes that surround a massive tree. This unearthly city's landmarks include the
Pokémon Fan Club
and the
Laverre Gym
, which is housed inside the ancient tree itself. The region's
Poké Ball Factory
stands to the north.

was a tough road, so stop by the Pokémon Center for a quick rest.
Mr. Bonding
can be found inside, and will grant you the
Encounter Power
if you speak to him.
Tiny and Tall
Two of the locals would like to see Pokémon of extreme sizes. The guy near the southeast gate would like to see a Pokémon shorter than 12 inches, while the girl near the café in the northeast wants to see a Pokémon taller than 9'10". Each one gives out a
Poké Doll
in return. Each request may be completed once per day.
Pokémon Fan Club
Visit the
Pokémon Fan Club
in the northwest and speak to the chairman. If any of your Pokémon have become Fully Trained by using
Super Training
, you will receive an
Effort Ribbon
from him.
Battle-Combo Move Tutor
The local Move Tutor lives in the house to the east of the Gym. He offers to teach a very special move to any members of the
first partner Pokémon
families.
Chespin
and
Bulbasaur
can learn
Grass Pledge
,
Fennekin
and
Charmander
can learn
Fire Pledge
, and
Froakie
and
Squirtle
can learn
Water Pledge
. Using these moves on the same turn in a Double or Triple Battle will raise their power from 80 to 150, and activate additional effects.
Types Involved
Description
Creates a sea of fire where all non-
Fire
Pokémon lose 1/8 of their max
HP
every turn for four turns
Creates a rainbow that doubles the likelihood of a move's additional effect(s) for four turns
Creates a vast swamp that reduces the opponent's
Speed
by 50% for four turns
Laverre Gym
Laverre Gym
The
Laverre Gym
specializes in
Fairy-type
Pokémon. Use
Poison
and
Steel
attacks to deal serious damage, and avoid sending in
Dark
,
Dragon
, and
Fighting
Pokémon. Housed inside the ancient tree, this Gym is designed as a giant dollhouse. There are nine rooms, each with several warp panels. The yellow panels work both ways, so it is possible to return to the previous room. Whenever possible, take the warp panel on the right side of the room to reach the Gym Leader.
Valerie
's
Mawile
is up first. Though Fairy Pokémon are vulnerable to Poison and Steel moves, Mawile's typing removes this liability; focus on Steel's weakness to
Fire
and
Ground
instead. Her
Mr. Mime
may put up
defensive
walls
, so hit hard with physical moves to target its weaker Defense.
Sylveon
's
Cute Charm
Ability may infatuate any female Pokémon that makes direct contact; either use a strong special move, or send in a male with a physical attack to take advantage of its lower Defense.

to the north of town.
Poké Ball Factory
Poké Ball Factory
Like the name implies, every Poké Ball used in the
Kalos
region is produced here at the
Poké Ball Factory
. The facility is mostly automated, though a few workers remain to observe the process and to give tours of the building.

Trouble is brewing... a single

is blocking the entrance. Speak to Shauna, and she creates a distraction that lures the guard away from his post, giving you and Serena/Calem a chance to slip inside. Be sure to search the grounds for valuables before entering the facility.
Interior
You won't get very far before another Grunt gets in the way. Luckily, Serena/Calem arrives and battles the thug for you, allowing you to move on ahead. Ride the first conveyor belt to the west then north. Collect the
Metal Coat
from the middle area, then ride the second conveyor belt east then south. Climb the stairway and visit the northwest office; one of the workers inside restores your Pokémon to full health, while another reveals that you must reverse the belt direction to proceed. Head to the southwest corner to reach the control panel and reverse the belts. Ride the first belt eastward, and climb the next stairway to reach the president's office in the northeast. Inside, Team Flare is pressuring the president to side with them. Defeat the Admin and
Celosia
and
Bryony
attempt to battle you two-on-one, but Serena/Calem arrives just in time. She/He uses a level 37
Meowstic
, a level 39
Absol
, and her/his

at level 39.

Defeated, Team Flare ends their assault on the factory. As a reward, the president offers a choice of either a
Master Ball
or
Big Nugget
, but regardless of which you choose, he gives out both items anyway. Make your way to the entrance, where you meet your friends and discuss the recent events.
Outside, you receive a Holo Clip that assures that the attack on the factory will have no effect on Poké Ball sales. The next stop is
Dendemille Town
to the southeast, by way of
Route 15
.
Route 15
Route 15
Route 15
, or Brun Way, is a leaf-covered trail that links
Laverre City
and
Dendemille Town
, and also provides access to
Route 16
. There are many valuables among the dense leaves and crumbling ruins, though some are inaccessible at first.

The Boss
Head to the northwest corner, and a Punk Guy stops you. Impress him with your Roller Skate tricks; if you've learned the Backflip and the 360, he will let you continue north to meet "the boss". He has been waiting for someone who was born for beautiful skating. He believes that you have what it takes to master the most difficult trick, the Cosmic Flip, and kindly teaches it to you.

Dive Balls
if you can break his consecutive fishing record and hook more than seven Pokémon in a row. A combo is broken whenever you cast and fail to find anything. Try fishing in a narrow, secluded area to find Pokémon that are really biting!
