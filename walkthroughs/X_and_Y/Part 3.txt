Before long, Sina and Dexio reappear. She leads the way to

Pokémon Center
Speak to the PokéMilage representative to trade
Poké Miles
for items. The number of collected Poké Miles can be viewed on the Trainer Card, and are earned by trading Pokémon, passing by other players via StreetPass, and simply traveling around the region. They can also be redeemed on the

Inside, Sina reveals that
Professor Sycamore
is waiting on the third floor. On the way, speak to a female Scientist on 2F to receive five
Luxury Balls
. On 3F, the professor greets you and leads the way to his office, where he evaluates your Pokédex. Shauna and Serena/Calem arrive a moment later, and the professor suggests having a battle—with him! He uses
three rare Pokémon
, and while their levels are not very threatening, their diverse types can make coverage a bit more challenging.

for

, either
Charizardite X
or
Charizardite Y
for
Charmander
, and
Blastoisinite
for
Squirtle
. These mysterious stones cannot be used just yet, but will eventually enable these Pokémon to
Mega Evolve
during battle! He gives Shauna and Serena/Calem a chance to choose their Pokémon before Tierno and Trevor arrive. Sycamore gives a quick pep talk about being the best Trainer possible, and asks for help discovering the
Kalos
region's biggest mystery: the secret and potential of Mega Evolution. He suggests looking for hints in
Camphrier Town
to the southwest. On the way out, talk to the female Scientist on 3F to receive
TM54
(
False Swipe
), a restrained attack that is useful for catching Pokémon.
On 1F, Sina is talking to a man with wild red hair, who introduces himself as
Lysandre
. He intends to learn about Pokémon in order to build a better future. He talks about the
Holo Caster
, and making a more beautiful world. As he leaves, she worriedly wonders what kind of beautiful world he envisions. The others appear from Sycamore's office, and Serena/Calem asks to talk in Café Soleil, off to the west.
PR Video Studio
The PR Video Studio is located just west of Sycamore's lab. This facility allows Trainers to film ten-second promotional videos, which can be shared over the
PSS
. Speak to the clerk on the left to choose a style—Energetic, Cool, or Fun—before heading to the recording studio. The studio staff will create the first video, but afterwards Trainers may choose to create their own, down to the individual second. There are over 200 options to adjust when filming a video. Becoming more stylish will unlock new background music, poses, special effects, and backgrounds. Other options will also appear after meeting certain conditions, like entering the Hall of Fame or using the PSS frequently. Completed videos can be edited from any PC.
After filming the first video, speak to the Punk Girl on the set. Impressed with your first video, she hands out a
Lens Case
to mark the occasion. The Lens Case holds several pairs of contact lenses, which allows you to change eye color at any fitting room. In the green room, female Trainers can apply a variety of makeup, while male Trainers can opt for facial hair or temporary tattoos.
Coiffure Clips
Coiffure Clips is a salon between the Pokémon Center and Café Soleil. Their services allow a Trainer to change hairstyle, hair color, or both. Prices range from
$
1500 to
$
3000. New hairstyles can be unlocked by becoming more
stylish
.
Café Soleil
Continue west to find Serena/Calem standing outside Café Soleil. The two head inside, where they find
Lysandre
speaking to a costumed woman. Serena/Calem says that Lysandre is the head of
Lysandre Labs
, which created the
Holo Caster
. Lysandre insists that as a famous movie star,
Diantha
should want to stay young and beautiful forever, but she is happy to play many different roles. Given the choice, he would make the world a beautiful, unchanging place. He leaves, and she introduces herself before leaving as well.
Shutterbug Café
Shutterbug Café, on the southwest side of town, is the go-to place for aspiring photographers. Having already earned the first badge, it is possible to call Phil the Photo Guy from any of the Photo Spot signs scattered across the region. Phil sets up his camera, then it is up to you to take the perfect shot. Talk to the Backpacker here to earn items based on the number of pictures taken; a
Wide Lens
for 1-14 photos, a
Scope Lens
for 15-29 photos, and a
Zoom Lens
for 30 or more.

. After that, talk to the two men in the northeast corner of 2F; one hands out three
Quick Balls
, while the other hands out three
Timer Balls
.
A third building, the Lumiose Transportation Office, is located near the Route 4 entrance. The woman at the counter details the city's three methods of transportation; the Gogoat Shuttle, an inexpensive and leisurely ride between North and South Boulevards; the Lumi Cab, an expensive but fast ride that leads directly to the destination; and the TMV, a high-speed rail that runs to the far-off
Kiloude City
. Unfortunately, all three methods are currently inoperable due to the blackout.
Café Introversion
Café Introversion, near the Route 4 entrance, is a quiet place for shy people that still enjoy all kinds of communication features.
Restaurant Le Nah
Restaurant Le Nah is a one-star restaurant near the city's Route 4 entrance. Here, patrons can pay

Route 5
. A Furfrou's coat grows back five days later.
Café Woof

Meet Korrina
Immediately upon reaching

Lucario
. Its Trainer rolls up on her skates a second later with her other Lucario, and suggests that the first may have been drawn in by your aura. She introduces herself as
Korrina
, the Gym Leader of
Shalour City
, and the three depart.
Tierno and Trevor
Tierno
and
Trevor
can be found a short distance to the southwest of the Skate Park. They are having a conversation about Tierno's dancing as you arrive, and Tierno challenges you to a battle.

Afterwards, Trevor explains
Horde Encounters
. These battles occur when five wild Pokémon appear at once. All five are usually of the same species, though sometimes four of one species will be accompanied by an individual of another. These Pokémon appear at a lower level than others in the area, but all five can attack in a single turn. It is impossible to attempt capture until only one remains, but a Pokémon found this way may have its
Hidden Ability
. Trevor hands out three jars of
Honey
, which can be used to trigger a wild battle, with a decent chance of it being a Horde Encounter.
Berry Tree
Climb the hill past Tierno and Trevor, then head south. Ride the rail downhill to reach the first of the region's Berry trees. Four berries are out of reach, but a fifth
Oran Berry
can be collected from the ground. Each tree yields one Berry per week.

On the route's west side, Roller Skaters Winnie and Florin are racing around a pair of traffic cones. Head north past them to reach a grind rail; this one has a notch in it, so build up some speed before going across. A second rail is located just west of the first, and this one leads to an item. This item ball is colored yellow, which indicates a TM or HM; in this case,
TM01
(
Hone Claws
).
Camphrier Town
Camphrier Town
Few settlements in Kalos are as old as

Meet Cassius
Visit the northeast cottage to find a powerful machine that is run by a Punk Guy named Cassius. It turns out that he runs the PC Storage System at the request of
Bill
, a friend in the distant
Kanto
region. After meeting him, the option shown on the PC changes from
Someone's PC
to
Cassius's PC
. It is even possible to access the PC Boxes by inspecting his server. He is happy to teach visitors all about PC Boxes, and one of the Punk Girls gives out
TM46
(
Thief
).
Name Rater
Speak to the old man inside the Pokémon Center, and he introduces himself as the official
Name Rater
. He is happy to critique your Pokémon's nicknames, and also allows you to change them.
Hotel Camphrier
Hotel Camphrier stands in the southwest part of town. Speak to the Rising Star in the lobby to receive a
Full Heal
. On Tuesdays, speaking to a traveler on the second floor will result in a
Shock Ribbon
.
Mr. Bonding
can be found on the second floor. This time, he enables the
Sp. Atk. Power
, and details the advantages of these powers.
Tasty Treats
Visit the northwest cottage and speak to the man inside. He would like to see a certain type of Pokémon, and when he does, he allows your choice of reward. He offers a
Cheri Berry
,
Chesto Berry
,
Pecha Berry
,
Rawst Berry
, and
Aspear Berry
to choose from. The type of Pokémon he wants to see is random, and changes every day.
Talk to the Maid in the same building to receive a
Sweet Heart
, a piece of chocolate that heals 20 HP. This can be done once per day.
Shabboneau Castle
Shabboneau Castle is located on the north side of town. The empty chateau once belonged to a generous noble family, who gave most of their belongings away. Cross the drawbridge and step inside to find Shauna talking with the building's caretaker. Professor Sycamore had hoped that more could be learned about
Mega Evolution
here, but the caretaker has never heard of it before. Suddenly, a man enters and calls the caretaker away to a problem on
Route 7
, and Shauna suggests going there as well. Before leaving, be sure to collect the
Escape Rope
on the second floor.
