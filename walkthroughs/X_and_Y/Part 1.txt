Aquacorde Town
Intro
The player is immediately given a choice of several languages—English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, and Korean—in which to play. After the title screen, the resident researcher of the
Kalos
region,
Professor Augustine Sycamore
, appears and introduces new Trainers to the Pokémon world. He asks the player to select a gender, then personalize the character further with one of three skin tones and hair color pairings. Gender and skin tone cannot be changed, but clothing, eye color, and hair length and color can be customized later on. Next, Sycamore asks for the character's name, which can now be up to twelve characters long. With that done, Sycamore sends the player off to begin their journey!
A
Fletchling
belonging to
Calem
/
Serena
's family flies upstairs to find him/her still in bed, fast asleep. It dive-bombs the unsuspecting Trainer, who wakes up in an instant.
Vaniville Town
Vaniville Town
The journey begins in
Vaniville Town
, a small, quiet community nestled in the lush southern hills. Calem/Serena has just recently moved here, and could not ask for a nicer place to live!

After rolling out of bed, examine the mirror on the wall to swap Calem/Serena's pajamas for street clothes. Head downstairs and talk to
Mom
, who suggests going outside and saying hello to the neighbors. It does not take long to find them; Serena/Calem and
Shauna
are waiting right outside! They claim that
Professor Sycamore
has heard of you, even having just recently moved to
Vaniville
. After that, they invite you to join them in the neighboring town of
Aquacorde
, where Shauna excitedly claims that everyone will get a Pokémon!
Route 1
Route 1
, or Vaniville Pathway, is one of the smallest routes around. This straight pathway simply connects
Vaniville Town
and
Aquacorde Town
to the north. Though short, it makes for a pleasant stroll. It has no items or wild Pokémon.

There is even more to see and do in
Aquacorde Town
than there is in
Vaniville
. Local businesses sell items that are crucial for beginning Pokémon Trainers. If only you had a Pokémon of your own...

The Meeting Place
Your new friends call out to you upon entering the town. The four of them are sitting at an outdoor table in the southwest, excitedly talking to each other.
Shauna
and Serena/Calem introduce the others as
Tierno
, a dancer, and
Trevor
, an aspiring researcher. The others insist on giving you a nickname, but are kind enough to let you choose one. Then Shauna asks Tierno to show them their new Pokémon!

The
Grass-type
Chespin
has the most weaknesses of the trio, with five:
Fire
-,
Bug
-,
Poison
-,
Flying
-, and
Ice-type
attacks. It and its evolutions specialize in
Defense
,
Attack
, and
HP
. Its Grass moves are strong against
Water
-,
Rock
-, and
Ground-type
Pokémon. Its final form,
Chesnaught
, gains a secondary
Fighting
type.
The
Fire-type
Fennekin
is great when battling
Grass
-,
Bug
-,
Ice
-, and
Steel-type
Pokémon, but is vulnerable to
Water
,
Rock
-, and
Ground-type
moves. It and its evolved forms focus on
Special Attack
,
Speed
, and
Special Defense
. Its final form,
Delphox
, gains a secondary
Psychic
type. Delphox is the only final starter form to resist moves from the new
Fairy
type, as
Chesnaught
and
Greninja
both take double-damage from such moves.
The
Water-type
Froakie
has an advantage when facing
Fire
-,
Rock
-, and
Ground-type
Pokémon, but may struggle against
Grass
- and
Electric-type
attacks. It and its evolutions are
Speed
-,
Special Attack
-, and
Attack
-oriented. Its final form,
Greninja
, gains a secondary
Dark
type, which gives it an immunity to
Psychic-type
moves.
Super Training
and
Pokémon-Amie
are now available on the Touch Screen.
After choosing a Pokémon, Shauna gives you a chance to nickname it. After that, she chooses the Pokémon with a weakness to yours, and Serena/Calem takes the third. Trevor then gives you a
Pokédex
, a gift from the professor. Finally, Tierno hands over another item, the
Prof's Letter
, which is addressed to
Mom
, before he and Trevor run off. As you try leaving for home, Shauna challenges you to a battle!

Afterwards, Shauna heals both Pokémon to full health before returning to the table with Serena/Calem.
Vaniville Town
Home
Return home to
Vaniville
and deliver the
Prof's Letter
to
Mom
. She wonders if it is a love letter, comments on the fancy handwriting, and then accepts
Sycamore
's request to allow her child on an adventure. She gives you a
Town Map
, a
Potion
, and even a change of clothes to start the new Trainer off on the right foot.

Aquacorde Town
Aquacorde
has two different shops, a
Potion
shop in the east and a
Poké Ball
shop in the west. Purchasing ten Poké Balls at once, at any location, earns you a bonus
Premier Ball
. While not an official
Pokémon Center
, Pokémon can be restored to full health at the building with the red awning. Stock up on supplies and speak to the shopkeeper near the fountain for a free Potion. Head north across the bridge to reach
