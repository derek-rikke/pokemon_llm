Sea Spirit's Den
The first wild Pokémon you encounter after meeting Professor Sycamore in Lumoise Station (after becoming the new Champion) will be one of three legendary bird Pokémon from the far-off
Kanto
region. Only one has been spotted in
Kalos
, and the one that appears depends on your starter Pokémon. However, the bird will flee immediately after the battle begins, and begin roaming the region. After the first encounter, the Pokédex is able to track its location. After encountering the Pokémon eleven different times, it will travel to the
Sea Spirit's Den
in
Azure Bay
, where you finally have a chance to capture it. Consider stocking up on
Ultra Balls
,
Dusk Balls
,
Quick Balls
, or
Timer Balls
for this battle.

attacks to wear its health down quickly, then follow up with

moves to whittle it down further.
Zapdos
is the fastest of the three. Begin with super-effective
Rock
- or
Ice-type
moves, before wearing it down gradually with
Bug
-,
Grass
-,
Flying
-,
Fighting
-, or
Steel-type
attacks.
Moltres
is the most offensive-oriented of the group. Open with
Water
-,
Electric

attacks, then follow up with
Grass
-,
Fire
-,
Bug
-,
Fighting

Pokémon Village
Unknown Dungeon
Fly to
Snowbelle City
and make your way through the Winding Woods of
Route 20
again. When you reach
Pokémon Village
, surf upriver to find that the man that had blocked the cave entrance is gone, so you can finally investigate his claims of powerful Pokémon inside. Unlike
another cave of the same name
, this one features only a single small chamber. The legendary Pokémon,
Mewtwo
, can be found in the center of this chamber, standing with its back to the entrance.

Mewtwo excels in Special Attack and Speed. Start off with
Bug
-,
Ghost
-, or
Dark-type
moves to weaken it quickly before following up with
Fighting
and
Psychic
attacks. Since it can restore its health with
Recover
, consider using status-inflicting moves like
Spore
or
Thunder Wave
to restrict its use. Alternatively, you could simply use the
Master Ball
you received in the
Poké Ball Factory
.

Terminus Cave
Terminus Cave
is a former coal mine that was closed due to rumors of a monster living deep inside. A chill wind blows through this forbidding cave, which houses plenty of treasure for the boldest adventurers. Though the cave was accessible when you first reached
Route 18
, it was impossible to reach the final chamber until now.

. Go back and head southwest to jump two ledges. Inspect the small rock here for a hidden
Dusk Ball
. Follow the path uphill and check the stalagmite near the bridge for a

beyond it, then return to Worker Narek and head east. Battle Hiker Aaron and cross the bridge. Go down the slope, head south, then jump the few ledges to reach an
Escape Rope
and Hiker Bergin. Follow the path back to Hiker Aaron, cross the bridge, and go down the slope again. This time, head north past Worker Dimitri. Use
Rock Smash
to find a

The layout of the final chamber is shaped similarly to a windmill. Each of the four tunnels leads to a rare item. The southwest tunnel leads to an
Adamant Orb
, the southeast tunnel, a
Lustrous Orb
. The northwest tunnel holds a
Griseous Orb
, and the northeast tunnel leads to a hidden
Big Nugget
. At the point where these tunnels meet, the legendary Pokémon watches you from atop a small hill.
Zygarde
, the Order Pokémon, is a
Dragon
/
Ground
type. Open with
Ice
-,
Dragon
-, and
Fairy-type
attacks to wear its health down quickly. After that, switch to
Fire
-,
Poison
-, and
Rock-type
moves to weaken it further. Just remember, if it uses
Camouflage
, it becomes a pure-Rock type Pokémon.
