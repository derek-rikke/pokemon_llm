, and runs alongside one of its largest rivers. The path links
Camphrier Town
and
Connecting Cave
, while
Route 6
branches off to the north. The
Berry fields
are to the south. Other landmarks include the
Pokémon Day Care
and
Battle Chateau
- though you're not able to visit them just yet.

Berry Fields
Southwest of
Camphrier Town
is an orchard known as the
Berry fields
. At the entrance, you are approached by a man and his daughter, who ask for help taking care of the orchard. Accept their request, and the man hands out five
Oran Berries
and five
Pecha Berries
, as well as a
Sprinklotad
to water them. These fields are the only location where Berries can be planted, and it is important to return occasionally to remove weeds and fight off hungry
Bug
Pokémon. Excess Berries can be turned into
Mulch
—
Amaze
,
Boost
,
Rich
, or
Surprise
varieties—by using the composter. Different Berry combinations produce different types of Mulch.
Mutations
Mutations may occur when two different trees are planted next to each other. After the first mutation occurs, a Scientist will visit the area, and set herself up in the family's house to begin collecting data. Thirteen Berries can only be found through mutations, while another fourteen can only be obtained from faraway regions.

The Caretaker and the Crisis
Continue west from the Berry fields to find the castle caretaker. A
Snorlax
has fallen asleep on the bridge, and only a
Poké Flute
can wake it. The caretaker used to have one, but it now resides in
Parfum Palace
to the north.
Route 6
Route 6
Route 6
, or Palais Lane, leads north from
Route 7
to
Parfum Palace
. Northbound travelers are required to take the main road, but when leaving the palace, it is possible to explore the paths through the tall grass on either side. When walking down the main road, if you walk near the bushes very closely, occasionally you'll come across a bush to which a wild Pokémon will jump out and attack you.

Entrance
Speak to the Tourist on the dirt path to receive an
Oran Berry
. There is also a Photo Spot to the southeast, and an
Ether
to the northwest. Shauna catches up to you near the gate. To enter the palace, visitors must pay a
$
1,000 fee, which goes toward repairs and restoration... probably. Admission is free for those with less than
$
1,000.
Interior
On the first floor, you and Shauna witness the building's owner frantically searching for his
Furfrou
, so she suggests helping out. North of the entrance is a doorway leading out to the courtyard, and the first room to the left holds a bed where your Pokémon can rest. Speaking to the several other visitors will give some insight into the region's past.
On the second floor, stop in the westernmost room to obtain an
Amulet Coin
, which doubles the amount of prize money if the holding Pokémon takes part in battle.
Courtyard
Cross the bridge to the gardens, where Shauna rushes past to check the north side. Visit the southwest hedge to obtain
HM01
(
Cut
), then head to the northwest hedge. Furfrou is here, but runs off to the northeast when Shauna arrives. Seeing a dead-end path, she suggests chasing it there. There are three areas where she can stand guard to prevent Furfrou's escape. Talk to her at the entrance to have her wait there, then approach Furfrou from the west so it runs to the north. Have her cover the east side, then loop around from the west, trapping it. The palace owner shows up to express his gratitude, then invites the two to watch a fireworks display from the balcony as thanks.
Balcony
Head back inside and climb to the second floor's center hall to reach the balcony. Talk to Shauna and the pyrotechnic display begins, after which the palace owner and his butler arrive. Shauna asks for the
Poké Flute
, and the owner instructs the butler to turn it over. Once the owner leaves, the butler also gives out
TM17
(
Protect
).

Return to the

bridge, and turn over the

to the castle caretaker. He warns that
Snorlax
will wake up grumpy, and asks if you are ready to fight it. Be sure to heal up and have some extra
Great Balls
before battling it. The creature is vulnerable only to
Fighting-type
attacks. It can raise its defenses with
Defense Curl
and
Amnesia
, but Physical moves will be more effective due to its lower Defense.

Afterwards, the palace owner and his butler appear. He attempts to patch things up with the castle caretaker, allowing him to keep the Poké Flute in order to practice more. The others take off, leaving you and Shauna behind.
Pokémon Day Care
The
Pokémon Day Care
is located just west of the bridge. Tierno and Trevor suddenly appear, and are excited to check it out. The woman at the counter will accept up to two Pokémon to raise at once. Pokémon left here will gain one
experience point
for every step taken. If a compatible pair are left together, the man outside may sometimes find an
Egg
! It costs
$
100, plus another
$
100 for every level gained, to retrieve a Pokémon.
Battle Chateau
Battle Chateau
Farther west, Trevor calls to you from outside a large castle, the
Battle Chateau
. Step inside to meet

and a man named Hennessy, who explain the facility.

Thanks to Viola's recommendation, Hennessy assigns you the title of Baron/Baroness, the lowest rank of nobility. By defeating enough other Trainers, this rank will rise to Viscount/Viscountess, Earl/Countess, Marquis/Marchioness, Duke/Duchess, and Grand Duke/Grand Duchess. When this happens, a servant will inform you as you leave. For receiving the Grand Duke/Grand Duchess rank however, you'll be informed when you enter the Battle Chateau.
Each rank allows you to fight opponents of an equal or lesser title. After reaching the higher ranks, Gym Leaders, Elite Four members, and even the Champion may be encountered. While most ranks are achieved based on the total number of points acquired which are determined by the rank of your opponent, for achieving the final rank, all the regular trainers must have been encountered at least once (not counting Diantha, the Gym Leaders, or Elite Four members).

Multi Battle!
Serena/Calem is waiting just west of the chateau, hoping to strike up a
Multi Battle
. Agree to the proposal in order to join forces with her/his
Fletchling
and second-stage starter Pokémon. Since Tierno has only one Pokémon, try taking out his
Corphish
first in order to focus on Trevor's team.

Connecting Cave
Connecting Cave
Connecting Cave
is an eerie place that links
Route 7
to
Route 8
and
Cyllage City
. The many
Zubat
that make their home here have earned it the nickname, Zubat Roost. As the northern tunnel is blocked by boulders, travelers must take the southern shortcut to Route 8. This visit is a quick one, but the Scientist on the south side is happy to heal a Trainer's Pokémon at any time.
