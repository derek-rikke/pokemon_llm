Sycamore
and his assistant

appear as you enter the town. The professor imparts a few details about the legendary Pokémon,
Xerneas

/
Yveltal

. According to his research, those that saw it were so overwhelmed by its power, they were only able to describe it as resembling a certain letter. Dexio asks where a Pokémon like that could be, and the professor claims that when it loses all of its vitality, the legendary Pokémon goes to sleep in a secret place. As his research materials are 1,000 years old, not even he knows where it might be located.
Pokémon Center
Mr. Bonding
can be found inside the local Pokémon Center. Speak to him to be awarded the
Accuracy Power
O-Power. Before leaving, talk to the woman near the Poké Mart to receive a
Sitrus Berry
.
Madam Reminder and Move Deleter
The southeast house belongs to
Madam Reminder
and the
Move Deleter
. In exchange for one
Heart Scale
, this old woman will help a Pokémon recall a move that it had forgotten. The old man's mind isn't what it used to be, but he can still help a Pokémon forget any move for free.
Mountain Pokédex rating
Continue up the street to the northeast house. The Monsieur inside would like to see how many Pokémon you've recorded in the Mountain Pokédex listing. If you have seen 70 or more, he will reward you with a
Shell Bell
.
Gigantic Gourgeist
No one will believe the Preschooler in the northwest house when he claims that he saw a huge
Gourgeist
. If you caught a rare
Super Size
Pumpkaboo
on
Route 16
and evolved it to Gourgeist, the kid will reward you with a
Big Nugget

Visit the house next to the boutique and talk to the Psychic inside. He gives you

(

), a move that changes type depending on the Pokémon using it. Speak to him again to learn the type it will become when used by one of your Pokémon.
Learn the Story of the Legendary
Enter the house north of the boutique and speak to the Monsieur inside. This knowledgeable man recounts the story of the region's legendary Pokémon,
Xerneas
X
/
Yveltal
Y
.
Xerneas
"It happened around 800 years ago. The Pokémon known as Xerneas used its shining horns to illuminate the lands of Kalos. At that very moment, people and Pokémon throughout the land felt great energy and vitality surge through their bodies. At the same time, a vast forest sprang up, with Xerneas at its center. Legend has it that, when it nears the end of its thousand-year life span, Xerneas releases all of its remaining energy, sharing it with all living things nearby. There's another story I know that talks of the appearance of just such a fortuitous Pokémon. Back 3,000 years ago, the Kalos region was engulfed in a terrible war. So the tale goes, a Pokémon came to the rescue of all the wounded Pokémon that had been caught up in the conflict. Some people suspect the Pokémon that appeared was Xerneas, but there's no way to know. Maybe they just wished a Legendary Pokémon had come to the rescue to brighten a tale of woe. Supposedly, after Xerneas had released its remaining energy, it transformed into a dried-up tree. It remains in hiding deep within the forest. According to old tales, as I say. Stories and tales."
Yveltal
"It happened around 800 years ago. The Pokémon known as Yveltal spread its ominous wings, engulfing the lands of Kalos in darkness. At that moment, people and Pokémon throughout the land began to fall one by one. Yveltal let out a piercing cry and took to the sky, vanishing to an unknown location. Stories say that when it nears the end of its thousand-year life span, Yveltal absorbs the life force of the living things around it in order to charge its own energy. Another tale talks of the appearance of just such a terrifying Pokémon. Back 3,000 years ago, the Kalos region was engulfed in a terrible war. According to the stories, a Pokémon appeared and stole the life force of countless living beings. Some people suspect the Pokémon that appeared was Yveltal, but there's no way to know. Maybe they're just using a Legendary Pokémon as a metaphor for war and pestilence. In the tales, after Yveltal finished storing the energy it had absorbed, it transformed into a kind of cocoon, remaining in hiding deep in the mountains. According to old tales, as I say. Tales and stories."
Lend a Pokémon
Visit the next house to the north to meet a lonely old man. Lend him a Pokémon of level 5 or less for some company to cheer him up. You can retrieve the Pokémon at any time.
Rival battle
Make your way to the Gym and Serena/Calem catches up to you, looking for another battle. Her/His team now consists of a level 44
Meowstic
, a level 44
Absol
, third-stage starter Pokémon at level 46, and a level 44
Jolteon
,
Flareon
, or
Vaporeon
depending on which Eeveelution has the same type as the player’s starter (treat Jolteon as a Grass type for this purpose).

Anistar Gym
Anistar Gym
The
Anistar Gym
specializes in
Psychic
Pokémon. Use
Bug
,
Ghost
and
Dark
attacks to deal heavy damage, and avoid sending in
Fighting
or
Poison
Pokémon. Stand in the room's center to reveal the Gym's interior, a colorful, spherical maze that seems to float in outer space. Use the yellow warp panels to progress through the maze, from blue to green to pink paths, until you reach the Gym Leader on the bottom floor.
Olympia
leads with her
Sigilyph
, which tends to raise her party's defenses with
Light Screen
and
Reflect
. Her
Slowking
's
Yawn
can force its opponent to switch. Both of these Pokémon share a weakness to
Electric
moves.
Meowstic
can cause problems for Ghosts with
Shadow Ball
, but still shouldn't be too hard to defeat.

Holo Clip
Outside, Serena/Calem returns for a rematch, but is interrupted by a Holo Clip from Lysandre. In a sickening revelation, you learn that he is Team Flare's leader, and he intends to use an "ultimate weapon" to eliminate everyone who isn't part of the group. Serena/Calem advises you to search for the team's headquarters; maybe Lysandre is where you first met him, in
Lumiose City
