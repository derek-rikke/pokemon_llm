To reach Lysandre Café, fly to the central Pokémon Center and cross Magenta Plaza. It's a well-known
Team Flare
hangout, so it's a good place to start looking for their secret base. Be sure to stock up on supplies before heading inside; there's sure to be some tough opposition ahead!
Lysandre Café
Take on the two Team Flare Grunts to learn of a secret door somewhere in the building. After defeating the two, you learn the door's password: "open sesame". Examine the china cabinet at the far wall to recite the password. The cabinet slides away, revealing the entrance to
Lysandre Labs

After he storms off, take a look around his lab. There are two types of floor panels; spin panels send you spinning until you hit a wall, and warp panels teleport you around the building. Head west to reach the first warp panel, which leads to the northwest corner. The first of the team's four scientists,
Aliana
, has been waiting here for you.

Afterwards, she moves away, giving you access to the next two warp panels. Take the green panel to warp to the southwest corner, then head north over spin panels and past a second Grunt to enter the northwest office.
NW office
The Defenders of Kalos are here, searching for a very tall person that Team Flare is also hunting for, but they can't reveal any more than that. However, they hand over three
Revives
to help you out.
Central room
Take the spin panels southward to reach the western room.
West room
In the break room, a Grunt mistakes you for a comrade and gives you
TM12
(
Taunt
). Grab the
Revive
and take a rest in one of the beds, if needed.
Central room
Head northeast, battling three more Grunts on the way, and step inside the northeast room.
NE room
Enter the northeast room to battle two more scientists,

Afterwards, they reveal more of Team Flare's plan. The group is using the electricity stolen from the Power Plant to fuel the ultimate weapon, but that's not all. They also plan to use the large stones on
Route 10
to siphon additional power from Pokémon near
Geosenge Town
. Those stones mark the graves of Pokémon that perished when the ultimate weapon was unleashed 3,000 years ago, and the group is planning for the same thing to happen again!
Central room
There are three spinner panels to the south. Take the westernmost one to a warp panel in the southwest, near the elevator. This leads you to the northeast corner; grab the
Black Glasses
and fight off the Grunt to reach the next warp panel. This one leads to the north-central room, which holds a
Rare Candy
and research materials that detail Kalos' dark past and Lysandre's own history. The reports on the table read:
"When I was young, I went on a journey around Kalos with my Pokémon. I reached out to help those suffering because they had nothing. At first, they were grateful, but eventually, they began to take my help for granted and demand more and more... Will fools like those people consume the Kalos region? This world is stable and secure. So the population of people and Pokémon continues to increase unabated. But there is a limit to the amount of money and energy the world is capable of producing. Either everything is lost, or only a handful are saved. This is something best not left to man... I must use a tool of higher power..."
Return to the three south-facing spinner panels and take the easternmost one. Take the nearest warp to detour for a
Hyper Potion
, then continue southward. Battle the Grunt in the southeast corner, and take the warp panel here. Go northeast to reach the eastern room.
Eastern room
Inside, you meet the fourth scientist,
Mable
. Win this battle to finally obtain the
Elevator Key

Make your way back to the elevator, and ride down to B2F.
B2F
Go west down the long hallway to find Lysandre and his prisoner, the mysterious traveler from
Route 13
. Lysandre reveals the man's name,
AZ
, and the prisoner recounts
a tale of sorrow and loss
that sheds more light on the events that rocked Kalos three thousand years ago. He pleads with you to reclaim the key to the ultimate weapon from Lysandre, who leaves for the elevator, asking that you follow him to B3F.
B3F
Go north to find Lysandre talking with a fifth scientist, a man named
Xerosic
. Lysandre asks that you battle Xerosic to prove yourself as the "chosen one"; if you are victorious, he claims that the group will abandon their scheme.

Xerosic is impressed by your talent, and asks you to press one of the two colored buttons behind him. He tells you that one button will activate the ultimate weapon while the other will disable it. Lysandre promised that Team Flare would abandon their objective if you choose correctly, but Xerosic has other plans. The red button reawakens the weapon outright; the blue button does nothing, but Xerosic uses a remote control to reawaken it anyway. A short cut-scene shows the weapon emerging from deep underground, and Xerosic excitedly says that the poisonous flower has bloomed in
Geosenge Town
. Fly back there in a hurry!
Geosenge Town
The once-quiet
Geosenge Town
has been completely transformed by the ultimate weapon's reappearance. Many buildings have been ruined, with only the Pokémon Center, Hotel Marine Snow, and a couple of homes still intact.

Afterwards, Serena/Calem suggests searching for the legendary Pokémon. Take the northwest door to explore the rest of the area. If you approach the window behind Lysandre, you can catch a glimpse of the legendary Pokémon far below, being drained of its life force to power the ultimate weapon.
Hallway
The headquarters is filled with Grunts and high-ranking Admins. As you race to the basement, you must defeat several pairs of Team Flare fanatics. You're not alone though, as Serena/Calem battles by your side. Her/His team consists of
Meowstic
at level 45,
Absol
at level 46,
Eevee's evolved form
at level 46, and third-stage starter Pokémon at level 49. About halfway through the hallway, a friendly voice calls out to you; Shauna followed the two of you inside and wants to help out. When you reach the basement door, you find it sealed with a high-tech electronic lock. But this is no problem for Shauna, as
Clemont
happened to give her a device for figuring out puzzles. The device quickly unlocks the door, so hurry inside!
Basement
Team Flare makes its last stand in the dark basement chamber where the legendary Pokémon is being held. Shauna and Serena/Calem lure a few of the Admins away, leaving you to take out the rest one by one. Doing so rescues the legendary Pokémon from the brink of oblivion, but it must still be caught before it will join you.

Once it's caught, you may choose to swap out a party member for it. Soon after, Shauna and Serena/Calem reappear, followed by Lysandre.

Lysandre tells you that when the legendary Pokémon awakened, it reclaimed much of its energy that had been sent to the ultimate weapon. The weapon has little power left, but there's still enough to use it once! The weapon activates, firing into the sky a massive ball of energy, which then comes crashing back down. It destroys the weapon, causing it to fall back underground, leaving a giant crater in its wake. The Secret HQ and its entrance are also destroyed.
Aftermath
After fleeing the Secret HQ, Shauna and Serena/Calem meet you back at the crater. Trevor, Tierno, and the
Masked
Heroes
are also present. Following a short briefing, the group leaves for
Anistar City
. Before you can follow,
AZ
appears. He speaks a bit more about the king and his eternal Pokémon, and finally reveals that he is the former king that built the ultimate weapon.
Anistar City
As you leave the city, you receive another Holo Clip, this time from
Sycamore
. He wants to talk face-to-face, and asks you to meet him in
Couriway Town
.
