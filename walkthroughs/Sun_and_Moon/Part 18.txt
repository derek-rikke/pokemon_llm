VS Plumeria
After clearing the
Ghost-type
trial, the next task is to continue north through
Route 15
. When you reach
Aether House
, you and
Acerola
find
Plumeria
and a couple of
Team Skull
Grunts. Plumeria is annoyed that it's taking so long for the Grunts to deal with you kids, and decided to take care of things herself.
Hau
and Acerola take on the Grunts, leaving Plumeria to you. She prefers using
Poison-type
Pokémon, so
Psychic
- and
Rock-type
attacks are best against her team.

She taunts you after the battle, saying that if you want them to return the Pokémon they've taken, you will need to come to their base in
Po Town
. She and the two Grunts run off, and
Acerola
rushes into the building.
Aether House
It turns out that
Team Skull
has taken the little girl's
Yungoos
. Acerola informs you that Po Town has been taken over by Team Skull and that it is essentially their own private playground now. She suggests finding a man wearing a kimono on
Route 15
, as he may be able to help you reach the town. The little girl pleads for your help, and gives you a
Rare Candy
.
The Kimono-Clad Man
Make your way to the beach to find a man in a black-and-white kimono. This is
Grimsley
, a former
Elite Four
member from the distant
Unova
region. He tells you that he is about to flip a coin, and asks you if it will be heads or tails. It makes no different which one is chosen, as he accepts his loss and registers
Sharpedo Jet
in your Ride Pager. Sharpedo Jet can be used to cross bodies of water like Lapras Paddle, but can also jet forward to smash through rocks. Use your newfound ability to cross the water and continue north to
Route 16
.
Route 16
Route 16
Route 16
is a short route linking
Route 15
to
Ula'ula Meadow
. The Pokémon Center is a frequent rest stop for visitors on their way to the meadow. An Aether Base is located to the east.

Visit the

to the east to find what looks like a rock with red, yellow, and blue markings floating in some type of machine. This is the
Reassembly Unit
, which has two functions: assembly and separation. In conjuction with your
Zygarde Cube
, this machine can combine
Zygarde Cells
and
Zygarde Cores
to form a new
Zygarde
, or split the Legendary Pokémon into its separate parts. The
form
that an assembled Zygarde will take depends on the number of Cells and Cores in the Zygarde Cube.

Getting Past Security
Approach the entrance to
Po Town
and the two Grunts outside initially invite you to join
Team Skull
. But once they spot your
Z-Ring
, they pull you into a
Double Battle
instead. Defeat their two Pokémon and they disappear.
The Man in Black
Once the two guards have left, a man dressed in black approaches you. Noticing that you intend to enter the town, he asks if you are ready for this. Entering
Po Town
means being ready to live as
Team Skull
, or to take on Team Skull. He asks one last time if you are certain, and lets you inside the town.
