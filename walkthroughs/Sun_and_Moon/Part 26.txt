The Pokémon League
Pokémon League, Main Chamber
The
Pokémon League
is
Alola
's final, toughest trial. The most powerful Trainer in the region is about to be decided!
Main Chamber
The main chamber is shaped like a half-circle with four walkways, each leading to a separate chamber. Approach the central platform and
Kukui
explains the challenge. Every Pokémon League in every region includes four powerful Trainers called the Elite Four, and now Alola has its own, as well. Challengers must defeat each of the four to advance, and cannot leave unless they are defeated or give up. These elite Trainers may be challenged in any order.
Fighting Chamber
Hala's Chamber
The left-most path leads to kahuna
Hala
, the
Fighting-type
specialist. Two fists made of light appear from the pedestal behind him and a barrier seals the arena.
Flying
-,
Psychic
-, and
Fairy-type
attacks are best, but avoid using Psychic Pokémon as they tend to have lower physical
Defense
and most of Hala's Pokémon can strike back with
Dark-type
moves. His
Crabominable
holds a
Fightinium Z
, allowing it to upgrade its
Close Combat
move into
All-Out Pummeling
.

When the battle ends, the platform behind Hala glows in a rainbow-colored light. Stepping on this platform warps you back to the main chamber, just outside his door. The pathway outside lights up, leading to similar platform near the main entrance.
Rock Chamber
Olivia's Chamber
The center-left path leads to kahuna
Olivia
, the
Rock-type
specialist. Two cliff-like structures made of light emerge from the pedestal behind her and a barrier seals the arena.
Ground
attacks will deal serious damage to each of her Pokémon, though
Grass
,
Fighting
, and
Steel
moves are also effective. Olivia can fortify her team with
Carbink
's
Reflect
, which increases her active Pokémon's
Defense
for five turns, and
Probopass
'
Sandstorm
, which boosts the
Special Defense
of all Rock Pokémon by 50% for its duration. Her
Lycanroc
holds a
Rockium Z
, allowing it to upgrade its
Stone Edge
move into

.

When the battle ends, the platform behind Olivia glows in a rainbow-colored light. Stepping on this platform warps you back to the main chamber, just outside her door. The pathway outside lights up, leading to similar platform near the main entrance.
Ghost Chamber
Acerola's Chamber
The center-right path leads to captain
Acerola
, the
Ghost-type
specialist. Two ghastly, purple flames emerge from the pedestal behind her and a barrier seals the arena. It turns out that Acerola is here in place of
Nanu
, who refused the invitation for the position.
Dark-type
attacks are best for most of her Pokémon, but
Fire
and
Ice
moves are also useful. Her
Sableye
's rare
Dark
/
Ghost
typing means that it only sustains serious damage from
Fairy
moves. Her
Palossand
holds a
Ghostium Z
, allowing it to upgrade its
Shadow Ball
move into
Never-Ending Nightmare
.

Flying Chamber
Kahili's Chamber
The right-most path leads to
Kahili
, a previous
island challenge
champion and
Flying-type
specialist. Two large, green wings made of light emerge from the pedestal behind her and a barrier seals the arena.
Electric-type
attacks are the most effective here, but
Fire
moves work well on
Skarmory
and
Rock
moves deal serious damage to the rest of her team. Her
Toucannon
holds a
Flyinium Z
, allowing it to upgrade its
Beak Blast
move into

Champion's Chamber
Champion's Chamber
With all four elite Trainers defeated, the platform in the main chamber begins to glow in a rainbow-colored light. Step on this platform to be transported to the Champion's chamber. Climb the stairway to the battlefield to find... an empty throne? Inspect the chair to take a seat, and
Kukui
appears. There is one more person to battle in order to claim the Champion title, and of course it would be the professor! He is here to ensure your worthiness for the role and to celebrate the establishment of
Alola
's new Pokémon League.
VS Kukui
The professor has a well-rounded team with several different elemental types.
Fighting
moves work well against his
Lycanroc
,
Magnezone
, and
Snorlax
.
Rock
moves are useful against his
Ninetales
and
Braviary
.
Fire
-,
Water
-, and
Ground-type
attacks are also effective against his team. His final Pokémon varies based on the first Pokémon you chose, and holds the Z-Crystal that allows it to attack with
Inferno Overdrive
,
Hydro Vortex
, or
Bloom Doom
.

When the dust settles,
Kukui
congratulates you on becoming the first-ever
Champion
of the
Alola
region! The professor takes a moment to record this hard-fought achievement for posterity, and you receive the Island Challenge Champion stamp for your
Trainer Passport
. This stamp ensures that all Pokémon will obey your every command. The four elite Trainers enter the chamber to congratulate you as well, and warn that as the new Champion, everyone will be aiming for your title.
Hala
suggests a celebration so grand that even the sun and moon take notice, then you and Kukui travel back to
Iki Town
.
