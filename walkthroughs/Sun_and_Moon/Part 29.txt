After capturing the two creatures, report back to Looker and he calls
Anabel
back to the room. She is feeling light-headed again but tries to downplay her condition. Anabel compliments your battle prowess, as it was all she could do to keep the creatures away from town. She reveals that the beasts get incredibly aggressive when they spot her, as if they see her as prey or an enemy.
Nanu
enters the room with new intel; it seems that the latest sightings are coming from
Ula'ula Island
. Looker and Anabel are about to leave, and ask you to meet them at the motel on
Route 13
.

Visit the motel to begin the newest mission. Reports again indicate multiple specimens. Visit

and

Anabel
is still feeling unwell but leaves to protect the populated areas.

Return to the motel to report your findings.
Anabel
says that she has received word from HQ that there is only one Ultra Beast left, and leaves to make reservations for their long-delayed feast. While she is away, Looker informs you of an incident from 10 years ago when he visited
Alola
as part of another three-person team to eliminate an Ultra Beast.
Nanu
enters and continues the story, revealing that Looker's hesitation cost their remaining team member her life. Fallers—humans who have passed through an Ultra Wormhole—are bathed in some type of energy that the Ultra Beasts find familiar, and they seek out this energy in hopes of returning home. The International Police knew this and used the woman as bait. As you have passed through an Ultra Wormhole as well, you may be giving off the same energy. Anabel returns, and Nanu informs her that the last beast has been spotted on
Poni Island
. He leaves to wait for you all at the floating restaurant in
Seafolk Village
.
Poni Island
Seafolk Village
Visit the restaurant to find
Nanu
and
Looker
. Looker sent
Anabel
to the wrong location so she can regain her health while he continues his story. The two men found Anabel here, unconscious on the
Poni Island
shore, after their mission ended 10 years ago. She had lost most of her memories but knew she was from the
Hoenn
region, where she was a
powerful Trainer
who protected
some tower
there. But everyone has their limits, which is why Looker asked for your help distracting the beasts. The final beast is the toughest of the lot, so Nanu asks for a battle to test your skill.

Nanu leaves, and Looker relays his latest intel to you: a single specimen, codenamed UB-05 Glutton, has been sighted near
Poni Meadow
, and Nanu should be leading it into the nearby
Resolution Cave
. The mission begins, and Looker gives you another ten
Beast Balls
. Head to
Ancient Poni Path
and go northeast.
Ancient Poni Path
When you travel east from
Hapu
's house, you are approached by
Sina
and
Dexio
. While you were looking into
Zygarde
for them, they were looking into the
Z-Ring
and its connection to
Mega Evolution
, even here in a region so far from
Kalos
. But as Trainers, it is easier to show than explain, so Dexio challenges you to a battle. When his
Alakazam
appears, the
Alakazite
Mega Stone it holds is triggered by his
Mega Ring
. This allows Alakazam to Mega Evolve into Mega Alakazam for the duration of the battle.

Dexio explains that the Trainer holds the
Key Stone
and the Pokémon holds the
Mega Stone
; both are required to induce
Mega Evolution
. He gives you a Key Stone and an
Alakazite
and the pair head off. Continue northward through the ruins to reach
