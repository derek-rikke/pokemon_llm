When you approach the elevator platform, the elevator descends with
Gladion
. He has been meaning to thank you for what you did for
Lillie
and
Lusamine
. The only thing he can offer in return is a full-power battle with his new
Z-Ring
.
VS Gladion
Gladion
's
Crobat
and
Weavile
share a weakness to
Rock-type
attacks. Weavile and
Lucario
are both vulnerable to
Fire
and
Fighting
moves. Beware of Lucario's
Steelium Z
, which upgrades its
Metal Claw
into
Corkscrew Crash
with a base power of 100. His
Type: Null
has since evolved into
Silvally
; the
Memory
it holds will vary based on your first Pokémon.

After the battle, he informs you that
Lillie
is taking care of their mother at the
Aether Foundation
, and gives you a
Max Elixir
from her. Seeing that you and
Hau
are both going to keep getting stronger, Gladion realizes that he can't let his guard down yet. He smiles and tells you to keep winning before leaving toward
Tapu Village
. Take a moment to visit the village and rest your Pokémon before climbing onto the elevator.
Upper Reaches (Lower)
Head through the tall grass to the east to pick up an
Escape Rope
, then collect the
Zygarde Cell
a bit farther along on the left. Continue northward and enter the cave.
Icy Cave
Climb up along the tunnel as it bends around to the west until you reach a fork in the road. Go west to find
TM13
(
Ice Beam
) sitting above a ledge, then backtrack and turn northward. Continue on as the tunnel climbs higher to reach another intersection. First, head east to reach a winding path that leads to a pedestal that holds the
Icium Z
. Take the northern path to reach a
Full Restore
behind some rocks, then continue westward to find an
ice-covered rock
. Go north from here to climb to the cave exit.
Upper Reaches (Upper)
Climb up the small slope to the upper level. Pick up the
Max Revive
among the tall grass to the west, then climb onto the second elevator.
Peak
Pokémon Center
Visit the Pokémon Center to make sure that your Pokémon are prepared for the upcoming trial. Be sure to stock up on Potions, Revives, and items to cure status ailments. Challengers must face the four elite Trainers with no break, so there will be no running to the Pokémon Center if things get dire!
Madam Memorial
An elderly woman near the Poké Mart knows every move that each Pokémon can learn. In exchange for one
Heart Scale
per session, she can re-teach any move that may have been forgotten.
Rival Battle 7
When you climb up the slope to the west of the Pokémon Center,
Hau
catches up to you. He's cleared the rest of his trials and even went back home for more training. Once he heard that you were already climbing the mountain, he got here as fast as he could. He challenges you to a battle to determine which of you will be the first to reach the new
Pokémon League
!

Disappointed with his defeat, he promises to keep training so that he can come back the next time and defeat you and your
Champion
title. He gives you three
Max Revives
and runs off with a parting wave.
Prepare with the Professor
When you reach the summit, you find
Professor Kukui
waiting to congratulate you on clearing the island challenge. He explains that as
Mount Lanakila
has always been where the challenge ends, he built the
Pokémon League
here as well, as high into the heavens as possible to honor the Legendary Pokémon. It seems he got the idea when he traveled to
Indigo Plateau
and took on the Pokémon League of the far-off
Kanto
region.
