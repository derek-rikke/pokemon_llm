Tapu Village
Tapu Village
Tapu Village
connects
Route 13
with
Route 14
to the south and
Route 15
to the north. The area is the site of a former settlement on the south side of
Ula'ula Island
. It mostly consists of ruined buildings that were destroyed by
Tapu Bulu
, as retribution for the construction of the
Thrifty Megamart
on its sacred grounds. As a result, the only functional structure in the village is the
Pokémon Center
. To the north, a stairway leads up to
Mount Lanakila
.

Meet Up with Hau
When you reach the branching path near the Pokémon Center, you find
Hau
waiting for you. He reminds you that you both are almost to the
Aether House
, where the next captain is supposed to be. He then notices some construction workers and is excited that there really is a Pokémon League being built atop the mountain. Hau informs you that other regions have a group of powerful Trainers called the
Elite Four
, and wonders if they or the
Island kahunas
would be stronger.
Route 15
Route 15
Route 15
encompasses the waters off the southwest side of
Ula'ula Island
. The
Aether House
stands just outside
Tapu Village
, and a sandy beach on the route's north end leads to
Route 16
. Although it is possible to skim the waves with
Lapras Paddle
, there are several large boulders near the surface that will hinder travel without
another Ride Pokémon
.

Security!
Step inside
Aether House
and
Hau
enters right behind you. The two of you are separately pulled into battle by a couple of Preschoolers trying to protect the place while
Acerola
is away. When the battles end, Acerola is just arriving. Hau asks where
Lillie
is, and she responds by saying that Lillie and
Hapu
should be along shortly. Acerola suggests getting the trial done first, and reveals herself as the trial captain. Speak to her again to learn that her trial takes place at the abandoned site where
the supermarket
used to be.
Team Skull Trouble
Exit the building to find
Lillie
standing up to a
Team Skull
Grunt, who seems to think she has a rare Pokémon in her bag. Defeat his single Pokémon and he runs off. Afterward, Lillie explains that she wanted to take a walk on her own to feel what it is like traveling as a Trainer, so she and
Hapu
split up.
Nebby
tried to get out of her bag and was spotted by Team Skull. While shopping, she was looking for something to help you on your journey and gives you five
Luxury Balls
. Acerola leaves the building and asks you to follow her back to
Tapu Village
, while Lillie goes inside to rest. Retrace your steps and head south from the village to
Route 14
.
Route 14
Route 14
Route 14
is mainly comprised of a black sand beach. The area is considered sacred to
Tapu Bulu
, who was angered by the construction work. This led it to destroy both the lighthouse and the
Thrifty Megamart
in a rage. Another supermarket was eventually built on
Royal Avenue
. The ruined building is now a favorite spot for
Ghost-type
Pokémon.

Catch Up with the Captain
Follow the beach to the trial gate to find
Acerola
. She explains that since the old building is full of
Ghost
Pokémon, the goal of her trial is to find the
Totem Pokémon
and snap a photo of it with the
Poké Finder
. It likes to play hide-and-seek, but taking photos of the other Ghost Pokémon inside should lead it into revealing itself to get in on the fun. The trial begins as soon as you enter the building. There are no wild Pokémon to be found until the trial is complete.

Captain Acerola's Trial
Sales Floor
Debris scattered throughout the building forces visitors into a linear path. When you reach the second checkout land, the conveyor belt starts moving all by itself! Inspect it to launch the
Poké Finder
and reveal a hidden
Gastly
. Snapping a photo attracts its attention, and the Pokémon pulls you into battle. Afterward, the conveyor belt stops moving and you spot a
Pikachu
running westward. Approach the westernmost checkout lane and suddenly a nearby shopping cart starts moving on its own! Go investigate to find a
Haunter
this time. Take a pic and defeat it in battle, just like before. When the battle ends, you notice another Pikachu leading you farther back into the building. Follow the path to the northeast corner, where you see a couple of dolls suddenly start levitating! Pull up the Poké Finder to reveal a
Gengar
. When you reach the back door, you hear the lock suddenly click open!
Back Room
When you reach the back room, you feel a pair of eyes sizing you up, then the Poké Finder launches on its own. Spin around to find a
Mimikyu
standing right behind you!
VS Totem Mimikyu
When the battle begins, the Totem
Mimikyu
is surrounded by an aura that raises every stat by one stage. As in other trials, it is recommended to focus on the Totem Pokémon first and any allies afterward. The
Ghost
/
Fairy
Pokémon has the
Disguise
Ability—the first time it's hit with a damaging move, its disguise is busted and it takes no damage. Use
Steel
- and
Ghost-type
attacks, like
Decidueye
's
Spirit Shackle
, for best results. The ally
Haunter
and
Gengar
that it may call are also vulnerable to
Dark
and
Psychic
attacks.

After the Totem Pokémon and its allies are defeated, you find yourself outside the building with
Acerola
. She inspects your photos and compliments you on your accomplishment, saying that it's very difficult to get a shot of
Mimikyu
. She rewards you with the
Ghostium Z
and teaches you the pose for
Never-Ending Nightmare
. With the trial complete, the captain gives you permission to catch the wild Pokémon in the old building, and also gives you ten
Dusk Balls
. She chuckles at your recounting of the trial, saying that there is no back room to the building. She gets an uneasy feeling and wanders off, while a pair of Pikachu ears can be seen moving beyond the fence behind you...
