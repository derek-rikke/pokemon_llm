Canyon
When you reach the cave entrance,
Lillie
gives you a
Max Revive
and heals your team to full health. Before entering the cave, inspect the fallen tree near the cave entrance to reach a
Max Potion
.
Cave 1
Walk eastward to battle Veteran Harry, then continue on to fight Backpacker Perdy. Use
Tauros Charge
to break a nearby boulder; inspect the hole beyond it to crawl through the ramp and find an
Elixir
. Jump the ledge and climb up the ramp. Use Tauros Charge again to break the rocks to the east for another
Max Potion
. Go west for a
Double Battle
with Ace Duo Kent and Aimee. Continue westward up the hill and use Tauros Charge to clear one last rock. Head through the opening to reach the canyon exterior.
Upper Canyon 1
There is a clear path westward, but detour through the tall grass to the southeast first to find a clearing with a
Revive
. Head westward over the land bridge, then turn north. Walk past the next cave entrance and around the cliff to reach an
X Attack
, then backtrack and enter the cave.
Cave 2 (North)
Collect the
Zygarde Cell
and head west. Battle Hiker Zachary and exit through the next cave opening to the southwest.
Upper Canyon 2
Detour to the east and inspect the hole in the cliffside to reach a separate part of the previous cave.
Cave 2 (South)
Battle Veteran Lynn and grab the nearby
Escape Rope
before heading south. Fight past Ace Trainer Junko to reach another hole in the wall; this leads to a dead-end area with
TM99
(
Dazzling Gleam
). Backtrack through the chamber and return to the cliffside.
Upper Canyon 2
This time, go westward to reach a large, wooden bridge stretching off to the north. At this point,
Lillie
catches up to you. She faces her fear of heights and, despite an attempt to scare her by a flock of
Murkrow
, crosses the high bridge in a trial of her own. Once she heals your team on the far side of the bridge, you are free to enter the next cave.
Cave 3 (Upper)
Walk westward down the first ramp to reach a
Zygarde Cell
near the Pokémon dens and roving dust clouds. Continue eastward down the second ramp and use
Machamp Shove
to move the first boulder southward and drop it into a hole. Pick up the nearby
Full Restore
, then go south and push the second boulder into the hole. Detour through the cave opening to the south.
Upper Canyon 3
Pick up the nearby
Dusk Ball
and collect another
Zygarde Cell
to the west, then return to the boulder puzzle.
Cave 3 (Upper)
Push the third boulder northward to the hole, then climb up the ladder to the east. Fight Scientist Ikaika and exit through the nearby cave opening.
Upper Canyon 4
Meet Mina, the Captain without a Trial
Battle past Punk Girl Anna and walk up onto the wooden bridge to meet a young, blonde woman. She introduces herself as
Mina
. A captain without a trial, she gives you the
Fairium Z
as a token of your meeting instead. Being an artist, as she leaves she wonders aloud if her trial could involve painting pictures and picking flowers.
Continue across the bridge to fight Punk Guy Adam, then cross the next bridge. On the east end, use the exposed tree roots as a ramp to reach the canyon floor. Head to the southeast to reach a tall grass patch; walk up the hill and jump the ledge to pick up a
Full Heal
. Go past Black Belt Earl on the way back to the tree, then head west down a large slope to reach a fork in the road. Go south first; this leads to the first cave where you can use
Machamp Shove
to create a shortcut to the main entrance. Return to the intersection and inspect the fallen tree on the west side; this leads to the lower level of the third cave, where
Lapras Paddle
or
Sharpedo Jet
will let you reach a
Rare Candy
and
TM35
(
Flamethrower
). Backtrack to the intersection again and venture northward this time to battle Ace Trainer Hiroshi, Veteran Heather, and Veteran Eric. Beyond them, a trial gate stands outside another cave entrance. When you reach it, Lillie catches up to you and heals your Pokémon.
Farthest Tunnel
When you enter the tunnel, you immediately notice an ancient stone monument with faded text that mentions a trial and a totem. There is no captain to be found, but this seems to be the edge of a trial site.
The Captainless Trial
Proceed along the tunnel until you feel a piercing gaze... a moment later, you are ambushed by a wild
Jangmo-o
! Once this first battle ends, you still feel something watching you, with an even fiercer gaze than before. Venture into the small, dead-end tunnel to collect
TM02
(
Dragon Claw
) and continue on. A short distance farther you are attacked again, this time by a wild
Hakamo-o
! After this battle, you feel the fiercest pair of eyes imaginable on you...

VS Totem Kommo-o
At the end of the tunnel, you find a pedestal with a glittering Z-Crystal. As soon as you try to grab it, the Totem
Kommo-o
jumps down from the cliffs above to stop you! The creature is surrounded by an aura that raises all of its stats by one stage. As it is a
