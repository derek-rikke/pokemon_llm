Introduction
Choosing a Passport photo
The player is immediately given a choice of several languages—English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, and Simplified and Traditional Chinese—in which to play. After that, they receive a video call from the resident researcher of the
Alola
region,
Professor Kukui
. As the character,
Elio
/
Selene
, is preparing to move to the tropical region with his/her
mother
, the professor welcomes them and gives a brief introduction to the Pokémon world. Next, Kukui asks the player to choose one of eight photos for his/her new
Trainer Passport
. This allows for the choice between gender and skin tone, which cannot be changed; clothing, eye color, as well as hair length and color can be customized later on. Finally, the professor asks for the Trainer's name, which can be up to twelve characters long. Kukui then ends the call, and the character's mother calls for help with packing away their belongings.
A short cutscene shows a mysterious girl and her unidentified Pokémon trying to escape a group of security guards dressed in white. Just when it seems that there is no escape, the Pokémon uses its power to teleport the pair to safety. The scene ends with the game's title and logo appearing on-screen.
Please note the
12-hour offset
between Sun and Moon, where daytime in one version runs concurrently with nighttime in the other.
Route 1 (Hau'oli Outskirts)
Melemele Island
Route 1
Iki Town
Mahalo Trail
The journey begins on
Route 1
, in an area known as Hau'oli Outskirts on the southeast side of
Melemele Island
. Mother and child have just recently moved to this tropical archipelago from the distant
Kanto
region, and could not ask for a nicer place to live!
Home
Three months after Kukui's video call, Elio/Selene and his/her
Mom
are enjoying their first day
S
/night
M
in their new home. Mom sends the family's pet
Meowth
to wake the child so they can start unpacking their belongings. Use the Circle Pad to climb out of bed, and after a short conversation with Mom, the doorbell rings. It's
Professor Kukui
, who officially introduces himself and welcomes the family to
Alola
, a long way from their native
Kanto
region. Mom tells Kukui that she still remembers him battling the
Indigo League
Gym Leaders
years ago, but that she fell in love with Alolan Pokémon and finally decided to move. Kukui laughs, saying that those Gym Leaders had shown him a thing or two. He then invites you to nearby
Iki Town
to meet the
Island kahuna
and get your very own Pokémon. Mom sends you to your room to get ready, so check the stack of boxes there to retrieve your
Bag
and hat.
Follow the Professor
The professor is waiting when you step outside. Go west to find him, then follow him up the hill along the west side of the route. Along the way, he points out other Pokémon Trainers battling wild Pokémon as well as each other.
Iki Town
Iki Town
is a small town in the middle of the island where people worship
Melemele
's
guardian deity
,
Tapu Koko
. The
kahuna
,
Hala
, lives in the northwest part of town.

The Missing Kahuna
The professor is confused, as he was expecting to meet everyone near the town entrance. He suggests that they may be on
Mahalo Trail
to the north, which leads to
the ruins
that
Tapu Koko
calls home. He asks that you track down the kahuna while he stays here so that they do not miss each other.
When you climb the stairway in the middle of town, you notice the same mysterious girl from earlier. It seems that the Pokémon in her bag wants to visit the ruins as well, so the two head northward.
Mahalo Trail
Mahalo Trail
leads up the hill from
Iki Town
to the
Ruins of Conflict
. Halfway along the path, you spot the girl pleading with the Pokémon to stay in her bag and out of sight. Upon reaching the hilltop, a cutscene plays which shows the girl running toward Plank Bridge. The Pokémon, a
Cosmog
, escapes her bag and lands in the middle of the bridge. Its happiness is short-lived, as it is soon under attack by three
Spearow
! She begs you for help, as she is too scared to do so herself. The aging, unstable bridge shakes three times as you try to reach
Nebby
, which you then protect by shielding it with your own body. A moment later, Nebby lets out a panicked burst of energy that destroys the bridge and sends you falling to the river far below. Just then, a crackling, yellow Pokémon swoops in, scaring off the flock of Spearow before diving down to save you and Nebby. It's
Tapu Koko
, who examines the group for a moment before flying off with a cry.
Afraid for its well-being, the girl scolds Nebby for using its power as it couldn't move for ages the last time it did so. The Pokémon finds a small rock called a
Sparkling Stone
and delivers it to the girl, who turns it over to you as thanks. She begs you not to tell anyone about the Pokémon, and, fearing another attack, asks that you accompany them back to town.

Choosing a Pokémon
Kukui is waiting when you return to town, and introduces the girl as his assistant,
Lillie
. Just then, some of the residents announce the kahuna's return. Explaining his departure,
Hala
states that as kahuna, it is his duty to resolve problems on the island. Lillie recounts the events at the bridge, and as
Tapu Koko
seems to have taken a liking to you, Hala is happy to offer you a Pokémon of your own and tosses three Poké Balls onto the stage.

The
Grass
/
Flying
-type
Rowlet
has the most weaknesses of the trio, with five:
Fire
-,
Poison
-,
Flying
-,
Rock
-, and
Ice-type
attacks. Its Grass moves are strong against
Water
-,
Rock
-, and
Ground-type
Pokémon. Its Flying moves fare well against
Bug
Pokémon, which are plentiful in the tall grass near your new home. Rowlet and its evolutions specialize in physical
Attack
and
Defense
. Upon reaching its final form, its secondary Flying type changes to
Ghost
.
The
Fire-type
Litten
is great when battling
Grass
-,
Bug
-,
Ice
-, and
Steel-type
Pokémon, but is vulnerable to
Water
-,
Rock
-, and
Ground-type
moves. Its Fire moves can toast the Bug Pokémon near your new home, making it a great choice for an easier start to your journey. Litten and its evolved forms focus on
Speed
and physical
Attack
. Its final form,
Incineroar
, gains a secondary
Dark
type.
The
Water-type
Popplio
has an advantage when facing
Fire
-,
Rock
-, and
Ground-type
Pokémon, but may struggle against
Grass
- and
Electric-type
attacks. It won't make a big splash until the second island, where its Water moves will prove useful against many of the indigenous Pokémon. Popplio and its evolutions specialize in
Special Attack
and
Special Defense
. Its final form,
Primarina
, gains a secondary
Fairy
type. There are few other Water Pokémon to find early on without the ability to fish or travel across the water.
Hala states that you and your Pokémon can only call each other partners when each has chosen the other. Human and Pokémon face each other on the stage, and after a moment, the Pokémon happily approaches its new Trainer, who lifts it high into the air. Hala, Kukui, and Lillie are relieved, and Kukui says that the two will surely be friends for life. After giving you a chance to
nickname
the Pokémon, Kukui hands you two important items. The
Pokédex
is a high-tech encyclopedia that automatically records data on every Pokémon you see or catch. The
Trainer Passport
includes all of your personal info, including your noteworthy deeds and accomplishments around the region. Kukui then suggests introducing your new friend to your mom.
Rival Battle 1
On the way out of town, you are approached by an unknown Trainer and challenged to battle. Hala scolds the boy, his grandson, for not introducing himself first, and so he gives his name as
Hau
. Hau and his Pokémon are excited for their first battle!

After the battle, the
Sparkling Stone
in your Bag begins to shine, and Hala asks to see it. Immediately recognizing the stone, he inquires about the events at the bridge, and wonders if maybe you are meant to be in Alola. He asks to borrow the stone for the day, and invites you to the town festival tomorrow. Kukui and Lillie then accompany you on the way home.
Route 1 (Hau'oli Outskirts)
Home
Back home, you introduce your new partner to Mom and Meowth, who are excited to meet the young Pokémon. Trainer and Pokémon are both worn out from the earlier events, and turn in until tomorrow.
