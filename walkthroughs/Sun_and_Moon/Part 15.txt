Stufful's Adventure
Speak to the elderly woman outside

. Recognizing you as a trial-goer, she asks for a favor. Her eight
Stufful
have not been getting much exercise lately so she let them out of their Poké Balls to play. They haven't returned yet, and as it is difficult for her to move around, she asks that you find them and send them back to her. Once they have all been located, speak to her again to receive a
Never-Melt Ice

VS Team Skull
Continue to the north end of the route to reach the bus stop sign, which is in the process of being stolen by a pair of
Team Skull
Grunts. Defeat one after the other to chase them off, then
Professor Kukui
appears. He mentions wishing that Team Skull would challenge "the League" instead of causing trouble, but refuses to go into more detail, saying that you will find out soon enough. Back to the matter at hand, Kukui explains that you will need to take the bus to reach the top of
Mount Hokulani
. Inspect the sign to wait for the next bus, and the Exeggutor Express arrives a moment later.

Catch Up with Kukui
When you step off the bus,
Kukui
calls to you from across the parking lot. He informs you that
Mount Hokulani
is only the second-tallest mountain in
Alola
, and directs your attention to another mountain peak visible through the mist. This icy mountain with construction equipment on its summit is
Mount Lanakila
, the highest peak in Alola. It is a sacred place, the closest point that anyone can get to the legendary Pokémon, said to be the sun
S
/ moon
M
incarnate. It is on this hallowed ground that Kukui has been working to establish Alola's own
Pokémon League
. He intends to have everyone who has completed their island challenges battle against the kahunas to become the island challenge champion. Then these
Champions
can show the world what is so special about Alolan Pokémon and their Trainers!
Hokulani Summit
When you approach the observatory,
Kukui
greets the man standing outside, who refers to the professor as "Royal". Kukui introduces the man as
Molayne
, the person in charge of the observatory and the one who maintains the
PC Storage System
. Although he is no longer
Hokulani
's captain, he challenges you to a battle to determine if you are qualified to take on the current trial. He specializes in
Steel-type
Pokémon, so
Fire
-,
Fighting
-, and
Ground-type
moves will work the best.

Captain Sophocles' Trial
To begin the trial, pass through the door behind the reception desk and enter the Captain's Gate in the hallway beyond. Inside you meet
Sophocles
, the inventor of the
Festival Plaza
. He says that since every trial boils down to summoning the Totem Pokémon and proving your strength to it, his trial skips straight to this part. He explains that the observatory uses technology to monitor sounds, inaudible to people, detected from outer space. Pokémon can hear these sounds just fine, and Sophocles has built a device that uses this tech to summon the
Totem Pokémon
. He informs you that using other sounds,
Molayne
was able to develop a security system for the building, and then activates the "Ping Totem Pokémon 2.0". The power suddenly goes out and Sophocles wonders if a fuse blew. With the electronic door stuck shut behind you, he explains that you will need to pass an audio quiz to deactivate the security system.
Sophocles will play an audio clip of a familiar sound. After identifying the source of each sound, the door briefly opens and shuts, letting in a Pokémon attracted by the device's sounds. Defeat
these wayward Pokémon
to progress to the next question. After answering the fourth question, the Totem Pokémon appears.
Correct answers are listed in bold.

Totem Pokémon
VS Totem Vikavolt
When the battle begins, the Totem
Vikavolt
is surrounded by an aura that raises every stat by one stage. As in other trials, it is recommended to focus on the Totem Pokémon first and any allies afterward. The
Bug
/
Electric
Pokémon has the
Levitate
Ability, which protects it from
Ground
attacks. Use
Fire
-, and
Rock-type
attacks for best results.
Torracat
can deal serious damage with
Firium Z
and
Inferno Overdrive
. Rock Pokémon, like
Minior
which can be found on
Mount Hokulani
, are also useful here.

After the Totem Pokémon and its allies are defeated, power to the observatory is restored. Molayne enters and congratulates Sophocles on his successful experiment. Sophocles rewards you with the
Electrium Z
and teaches you the pose for
Gigavolt Havoc
. Molayne congratulates you on clearing the trial and gives you the
Steelium Z
. He then asks for a favor: return the
Professor's Mask
that
Kukui
left behind. He tells you that the professor should be headed back to
Malie Garden
, so summon
Charizard
and fly back to the city.
