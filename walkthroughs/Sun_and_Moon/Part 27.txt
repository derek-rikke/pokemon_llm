Ula'ula Island
Haina Desert
Haina Desert
The Ruins of Abundance
Location on Ula'ula Island
Haina Desert
is located to the north of
Route 13
on
Ula'ula Island
. During daylight hours, the
harsh sunlight
turns the desert into a broiling labyrinth; at night, a
sandstorm
rages instead. The shifting sands make it easy to become disoriented, as traveling one way or another does not always lead where one might expect. Visitors must first brave the unforgiving terrain in order to reach the
Ruins of Abundance
.

Area 1
Go northeast and take the east exit. This leads to a dead-end on the west side of the same area, and a
Max Elixir
. Backtrack and continue northward.
Area 2
It is not necessary to take the west exit, as it only leads to the east side. Go north to reach the next area.
Area 4 (South)
This part of the desert is a narrow valley with large rocks blocking the way. Speak to the Hiker here at night, and after telling him that your Pokémon's eyes are "looking pretty bleary", he gives you a pair of
Safety Goggles
. Backtrack to Area 2, then go east.
Area 3
This area leads east, then north, with a
Zygarde Cell
near the plant growing in the middle. There is a man, apparently suffering from amnesia, standing near this plant. If shown a

Area 5
A large ring of rocks covers most of the area. The north exit only leads back to the Hiker from Area 4, and the west exit leads to the east side. Take the east exit instead.
Area 6
This dead-end path holds a pedestal with a Z-Crystal. Collect the

Use
Mudsdale Gallop
to reach the
Comet Shard
in the rocky terrain, then take the south exit.
