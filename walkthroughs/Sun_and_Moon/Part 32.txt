Meet Up with Mina
Mina
can be found near the entrance when you first arrive. She says she has just completed a hundred sketches and is taking a break. Having defeated all of the other Trainers in the area, the captain is bored and has nothing else to do. She challenges you to beat all of the Trainers in the area as she did, if you want to challenge her again. Defeating all of the Trainers and Mina herself earns you a

The Stuff of Legend
When you first visit the Battle Tree, you are approached by two young men. One of the men introduces himself as
Blue
, and the other as
Red
, both
Champions
from the far-off
Kanto
region. As a fellow Champion, they expect that you could give them a great battle, and give you the choice of which you would like to fight.
Afterward, Blue explains that they were called here to run the facility, and the two eagerly await your challenge.

Challenges
Challengers compete to see how many Trainers they can defeat in a row. Losing one battle will reset the challenger's win streak to zero. Each time a challenger defeats a Trainer,
Battle Points
, or BP, will be awarded. The longer the win streak, the more BP will be received. There are three formats a challenger can choose: Single Battle,
Double Battle
, or
Multi Battle
. The challenger needs three Pokémon for Single Battles, four for Double Battles, and for Multi Battles, two per Trainer. Lastly, challengers cannot use more than one of the same Pokémon or item.
There are two courses for each format: Normal Course and Super Course. A Normal Course challenge consists of 20 battles, the last of which will be against a
Battle Legend
. Upon successfully completing a Normal Course, the Super Course for the respective format will be unlocked, in which the challenger may rebattle the same Battle Legend on the 50th battle. Unlike the Normal Course, the Super Course is indefinite and ends only when the challenger loses a battle.
IV Judge
A male Ace Trainer can be found next to the PC. If you have hatched at least 21
Eggs
, he will update your PC with a feature that allows you to view the innate
IVs
of each Pokémon.
Exchange Service Corner
The area includes three Exchange Service Corners, where various items can be purchased with Battle Points earned in the Battle Tree.
