Slowpoke
, and it's up to you to step in and save the day. Defeat the first Grunt and they both run off.
Afterward, the Chief offers you a tour of the
Hano Grand Resort
on the southeast part of
Akala
as thanks, but you must first clear Olivia's grand trial.

Rockium Z
From Olivia, after clearing her grand trial
S
M
Upon reaching the exterior of the ruins,
Professor Burnet
arrives with
Lillie
. Burnet helped Lillie make her way to the ruins, which she was searching for in order to help
Nebby
. Burnet leaves, and Lillie heals your Pokémon to full health.
Olivia
emerges from the cave, explaining that she is here because
Tapu Lele
summoned her to clean up the ruins. Moving onto other business, the kahuna gives you a chance to prepare before starting her grand trial.
Akala Grand Trial
As a
Rock-type
Pokémon specialist,
Olivia
's team takes serious damage from
Grass
,
Water
,
Fighting
,
Ground
, and
Steel
moves. Grass Pokémon have access to
Grassium Z
and
Bloom Doom
, while Water Pokémon can make use of
Waterium Z
and
Hydro Vortex
. Alternatively, they can hold a
Miracle Seed
or
Mystic Water
for a reliable power boost. As it is part-
Flying
,
Dartrix
is susceptible to Rock attacks; the
Grass
/
Ghost
Decidueye
is stronger but should be wary of her
Lycanroc
's
Bite
.
Brionne
and
Primarina
are only vulnerable to
Nosepass
'
Spark
.
Olivia
starts off with her
Nosepass
. Though
Rock Slide
is stronger,
Spark
lets it face off with Water Pokémon looking for a type advantage. Its
Sturdy
Ability prevents a one-hit knockout. Ground Pokémon are an easy choice against it, as they are immune to Spark and
Thunder Wave
, and take less damage than normal from Rock Slide.
Boldore
can rack up damage with
Rock Blast
, or hinder the target's accuracy with
Mud-Slap
. Like Nosepass, it also has the Sturdy Ability. Both of Olivia's first two Pokémon have higher physical
Defense
than
Special Defense
, so Special attacks are more effective. Her Midnight Form
Lycanroc
resists
Sleep
with its
Vital Spirit
Ability. Its defenses are more equal, so either physical or special moves will do the trick. With the
Z-Crystal
it holds, at any time Lycanroc can upgrade its Rock Slide move, turning it into the Rock-type Z-Move,
Continental Crush
. While powerful, this can fortunately be done only once.

After the battle, Olivia rewards you with the
Rockium Z
and teaches you the pose for
Continental Crush
. She then stamps your
Trainer Passport
with the
Akala Trial Completion
stamp. This stamp ensures that all Pokémon up to Level 50, even those received in a trade, will obey without question.
Hau
appears as you turn to leave, hoping for a battle with Olivia. He mentions that
the same weird green guy
from
Aether
told him to visit
Hano Grand Resort
after clearing the kahuna's grand trial. Olivia advises you to find out what Aether wants, and tells you that the resort is located to the east of
Heahea City
, over the bridge from the Dimensional Research Lab.
