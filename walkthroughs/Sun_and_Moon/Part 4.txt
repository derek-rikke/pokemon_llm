Guzma's House
A small house stands across the street from the motel. The man inside says that he tried to stop his son from running away, but failed. The bedroom in the back has several trophies on display, each with a thin layer of dust.
Berry Fields
Berry fields
The
Berry fields
lay farther north. Despite the name, Berries cannot actually be grown here. The current owners moved here from the far-off
Kalos
region to promote the use of
Mulch
when growing Berries. However, due to
Alola
's tropical climate, Berries are able to grow very well on their own and so the fields have fallen out of use.

VS Team Skull
There is a
Delibird
standing in the road, looking helplessly toward the fields. When it notices you, it grabs onto your Bag and will not let go. Follow it into the fields to find a pair of
Team Skull
Grunts harassing the area's caretaker, in an attempt to steal the Berries stored here. The caretaker is unconcerned and tells you not to worry, but the pair attacks you before you can leave. Defeat the first Grunt's single Pokémon and the pair run off to harass
Ilima
in
Verdant Cavern
. The man then gives you an
Oran Berry
as thanks for your help.
Pokémon Center
Hau
is waiting outside the Pokémon Center for you. He informs you that
Verdant Cavern
is considered a sacred place to
Tapu Koko
, and is off-limits except to those on an island challenge. He gives you three
Revives
before stopping by the café.
A female Sightseer near the café is looking for a
Cutiefly
. Catch one on
Route 3
and speak with her again to receive a
$
3,000 reward.
Time for a Trade
There is a Lass near the Poké Mart who is looking to get a
Spearow
. If you have one to spare, she will happily trade her
Machop
for it. As
Ilima
's upcoming trial makes use of
Normal
Pokémon, the
Fighting-type
Machop will be especially helpful. Spearow are commonly found in Routes
2
and
3
.
Verdant Cavern
Verdant Cavern
Verdant Cavern
lies on the northeast part of the route.
Ilima
can be found standing outside the cave. He warns of the fierce Pokémon inside and suggests bringing extra Potions. Until the trial is complete, challengers are unable to leave the cave and wild Pokémon may not be caught.

Captain Ilima's Trial
Inside the entrance, Captain Ilima welcomes you to Verdant Cavern and explains the basics of his trial. The goal is to defeat three of the Pokémon that lurk inside their dens, then reach the pedestal in the next part of the cave and collect the
Z-Crystal
there. A loud noise from deep in the cave prompts Ilima to warn you of the
Totem Pokémon
, a creature stronger than all others here.
To begin, inspect the nearby den to battle the first Pokémon. Next, head east to find a
Super Potion
, then go north and inspect the mossy rock in the path to find a hidden
Revive
. A second den is located just north of the rock, and the second Pokémon runs out to attack you. Fight it off, then climb westward up the hill to a fork in the path. Go south first to find
TM31
(
Brick Break
) atop a few ledges that lead back to the entrance, then head north. Cross eastward over the wooden bridge to spot another Pokémon running into the third den. Climb the hill in the northeast and inspect the crawlspace to reach the other side. Pick up the
Super Potion
and inspect the den to find... nothing?! The Pokémon suddenly pops out from another den behind this one, on the upper level. Inspect that upper den, and the Pokémon appears from another den to the west. Grab the
X Defense
and check the western den to see the Pokémon back at the first den of the three. Cross back over the wooden bridge to encounter the two
Team Skull
Grunts from the Berry fields, here to disrupt your trial challenge. Defeat the first Grunt and his
Drowzee
. Then, as payback for their defeat, they block off two of the dens in an attempt to steal the Pokémon. Now that they have unwittingly helped you corner the remaining creature, check the third den to battle the final Pokémon.

Climb the hill and speak to the trial guide to enter the Totem's Den. The pedestal with the glittering
Z-Crystal
stands straight ahead. As you move to collect the treasure, you feel a piercing gaze. Pick up the crystal and the Totem Pokémon attacks! The creature is surrounded by an aura that raises its
Defense
by one stage. It calls its ally on the first turn; once the ally is defeated, it cannot be called again. Use
Fighting-type
attacks for best results.

After the Totem Pokémon and its ally are defeated, Ilima arrives and congratulates you on completing his trial. He rewards you with the
Normalium Z
and teaches you the pose for
Breakneck Blitz
, then gives you ten
Great Balls
before healing your Pokémon to full health. He claims to have something interesting to show you and asks that you meet him on
Route 3
.
With the first trial cleared, wild Pokémon may now attempt to call an ally for help, turning a
Single Battle
into an
SOS Battle
.
Leave the cave to find Ilima waiting outside. Having defeated his trial, he opens the nearby barricade so that you can proceed to the northeast. He explains that since he is the only captain on
Melemele Island
, your next step is to inform
Kahuna
Hala
of your victory.
Professor Kukui
arrives, and having spotted your new Z-Crystal, gives a quick tutorial on
Z-Moves
. When held by a Pokémon, a Z-Crystal upgrades any move of the corresponding type.
Normalium Z
affects
Normal-type
moves; damaging moves become
Breakneck Blitz
, while most Status moves will result in stat boosts. Z-Power can only be used once per battle.
Kukui suddenly remembers that he had lost
Lillie
somewhere on
Route 3
, and asks for your help in finding her.
