Po Town
Po Town
is located on the northwestern-most point of
Ula'ula Island
. The barricaded town has long been overrun by
Team Skull
and houses their base of operations, the
Shady House
. The team now runs the Pokémon Center, ensuring that their Pokémon have a reliable form of treatment. Visitors may also have their Pokémon healed here as well—for a price.

The First Barricade
When first entering the city, you are notice by a pair of Team Skull Grunts. They would like to battle you, but decide that moving their barricade to reach you would be too much work. They taunt you instead and tell you to go home, confident that you will never find a way inside.
The Assault on Po Town
Go west and inspect the hedge to crawl through the hole. This leads you back to the first two Grunts, who can't believe that you are stubborn enough to challenge them. Defeat them one after the other, then continue east to reach the Pokémon Center.
Controlled by Team Skull, the Pokémon Center has fallen into disrepair while the Poké Mart and Café are unstaffed. The team never passes up an opportunity to make money, so the female Grunt behind the counter offers to heal your Pokémon—for
$
10 per visit.
Leave the Pokémon Center and continue north. Both sides of the street have a hole in the hedges; take the eastern one first to reach a
Double Battle
with two female Grunts and a
Rare Candy
. Backtrack and crawl through the western hedge. Head to the street to fight the Grunt standing on top of the pickup truck. Enter the yard of the northwest house and walk over the stacked boxes to pass through a hole in the fence. Go east and detour through the hedge into the northeast yard to reach a
Smoke Ball
, then continue north to the
Shady House
.
Shady House
The
Shady House
serves as
Team Skull
's headquarters. The dilapidated mansion is covered in graffiti and grime.

The Shady House
Take the first door on the left to exit the building and find an
Ice Stone
near the swimming pool. Back in the entrance hall, go north and defeat the female Grunt in the western hallway. Enter the west-central room to get a
Max Revive
, then visit the northwest room. Inside, you find a note on the floor that lists a secret password:
Beat Up
. Return to the entrance and enter the room under the staircase. Defeat the female Grunt in the middle of the room and continue east; this leads to the blocked-off part of the eastern hallway. Visit the northeast room to find a
Heal Powder
and a second note on the floor with another secret password:
Tapu Cocoa
; it also reminds the reader that true Team Skull members always butt heads and answer with a hearty "No!". Backtrack to the entrance and climb the staircase.
2F (West)
Visit the northwest room to find
TM36
(
Sludge Bomb
). In the southwest room, defeat the Grunt to reach the
Iron
, and inspect the third note on the floor to learn a final password:
Golisopod
. Battle the Grunt patrolling the upper floor and speak to the Grunt guarding the balcony. To meet
Guzma
, you must give the three correct passwords—
Beat Up
,
Goliosopod
, and
Tapu Cocoa
—and when asked if you're sure, remember to answer
No!
.
2F (Exterior)
Go east from the balcony and cross the wooden scaffolding to the rooftop. Defeat the female Grunt and pick up the
Escape Rope
before climbing through the open window.
2F (East)
Continue on to reach the northeast room, which has been turned into
Guzma
's makeshift throne room. He soon realizes that you are here to rescue the little girl's
Yungoos
, which is being held back by another Grunt. Guzma warns that if you can't mind your own business you risk getting hurt, and draws you into battle.
VS Guzma
Guzma
prefers using
Bug
Pokémon, so
Fire
-,
Flying
-, and
Rock-type
moves will be the most effective.

Defeated, Guzma orders the Grunt to give Yungoos back to you. The Pokémon runs off to find the little girl, then the Grunt leaves the room. Guzma promises to beat you down one day before he leaves as well. Be sure to inspect the treasure chest to find the
Buginium Z
.
The Man in Black
When you leave the Shady House, you are met by the same man who let you into
Po Town
. He asks if he has you to thank for rescuing Yungoos before healing your Pokémon. Just then
Acerola
appears, referring to him as her uncle,
Nanu
. She thanks you for rescuing the Pokémon before leaving with it for
Aether House
.
Route 15
Aether House
Enter Aether House to find
Acerola
returning with Yungoos just now, as well. The relief is short-lived, as
Hau
reveals that
Lillie
has been taken by
Plumeria
. It seems that stealing the little Pokémon was merely a distraction.
Gladion
rushes in, expressing his shock that it was Lillie who took
Cosmog
. He is upset that no one was able to protect Lillie from Team Skull, and angrily draws you into battle.
VS Gladion
Gladion
's Pokémon are vulnerable to
Psychic
-,
Rock

attacks.

Afterward, Gladion apologizes for the meaningless fight. He had warned that
Cosmog
will bring disaster to the region, and is frustrated that the Pokémon was not kept safe. Gladion intends to leave from the ferry terminal, so either tell him that you are ready to go, or meet him there once you are prepared.
Malie City
When you reach the pier, you find
Gladion
staring out to sea. While the two Trainers are waiting for
Hau
to arrive,
Nanu
appears and expresses his dismay that
Team Skull
didn't keep their troublemaking confined to
Po Town
. He reveals himself as an
Island kahuna
and offers to battle you.
Ula'ula Grand Trial
As a
Dark-type
Pokémon specialist,
Nanu
's team generally takes serious damage from
Bug
,
Fighting
, and
Fairy
moves. Trainers with
Decidueye
should be wary of
Ghost
and Dark attacks. Trainers with
Incineroar
should be careful of
Rock
and
Ground
moves.
Nanu
starts off with his
Sableye
. As a
Ghost
/
Dark
Pokémon, it is only vulnerable to Fairy attacks.
Krokorok
's Ground typing also leaves it susceptible to
Water
-,
Grass
, and
Ice-type
moves. Beware of facing it with a physical attacker, as its
Intimidate
Ability cuts the foe's
Attack
! The same goes for his
Persian
as well, as its
Fur Coat
Ability doubles its physical
Defense
.

After the battle, Nanu is impressed with your victory and heals your team to full health. He then rewards you with the
Darkinium Z
and teaches you the pose for
Black Hole Eclipse
. Defeating the kahuna earns your
Trainer Passport
the
Ula'ula Trial Completion
stamp, which ensures that all Pokémon up to Level 65, even those received in a trade, will obey without question.
Hau
arrives just as
Nanu
is leaving. He is still beating himself up about not being strong enough to protect
Lillie
. He wonders aloud where she could have been taken, as your raid of
Po Town
showed no sign of her.
Gladion
mentions
Aether Paradise
, and the three Trainers board his
Team Skull
boat for the artificial island.
