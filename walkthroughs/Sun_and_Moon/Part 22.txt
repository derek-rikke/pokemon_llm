Walk down the coral-encrusted pathway to reach
Lillie
and Mudsdale at the bottom. Enter the shrine and use
Machamp Shove
to move the nearest stone all the way northward, then push the stone in the middle to the east. Loop around and push that second stone northward to drop it into a hole in the ground. Walk through the doorway into the second chamber to find
Hapu
standing atop the platform.
Interior Chamber
A great light shines from the altar, and Hapu is gifted her own Sparkling Stone, marking her as the new kahuna. She reveals that her grandfather had also held this role, but died suddenly years ago, leaving the island without a kahuna ever since. Lillie asks Hapu about the Legendary Pokémon, but Hapu knows only that there is a ceremony held for it at the
Altar of the Sunne
S

Altar of the Moone

. This ceremony uses two flutes to empower the Legendary Pokémon. Hapu recognizes the

that Lillie carries, and reveals that the other can be found on
Exeggutor Island
, an uninhabited island off the coast of
Poni Island
.
Seafolk Village
Fly back to
Seafolk Village
to catch up to Lillie and Hapu. Hapu and Mudsdale leave, and Lillie goes to speak with the village chief. After a brief conversation, you and Lillie set off on the S.S. Magikarp.
Exeggutor Island
Exeggutor Island
Location of Exeggutor Island
The small, uninhabited
Exeggutor Island
is designated as a nature preserve. Some

In Search of a Legend
As soon as you walk out onto the island,
Lillie
inadvertently disturbs an
Alolan Exeggutor
, which draws you into battle. When you reach the middle part of the island, the clouds roll in and it starts to rain, causing you and Lillie to run for cover in the nearby cave. The sun returns a short time later and Lillie runs back out of the cave, excited to see the rainbow high above. She wonders if maybe it is a good omen before continuing northward. Climb to the island's highest point to find Lillie in front of an old pedestal. Inspect the structure to take the

, then speak with the chief to return to
Seafolk Village
.
Seafolk Village
Now that you and
Lillie
have both the
Sun Flute
and the
Moon Flute
, the next step is to play them at the altar. The chief informs you that the altar is located in
Vast Poni Canyon
. He wishes you luck, warning that the road ahead is long as nature acts as its own trial.
Ancient Poni Path
Pass by
Hapu
's house and head north to find
Lillie
confronted by a group of
Team Skull
Grunts blocking the road. They need to know how to save
Guzma
, and intend to knock that information out of you.

Poni Grand Trial
Follow
Lillie
northward to meet
Hapu
and Mudsdale under a large, dead tree. She asks if you are ready to take on her Pokémon at full strength, and gives you the chance to prepare if you are not. As a
Ground-type
Pokémon specialist,
Hapu
's team takes serious damage from
Grass
,
Water
, and
Ice
attacks. Grass Pokémon have access to
Grassium Z
and
Bloom Doom
, while Water Pokémon can make use of
Waterium Z
and
Hydro Vortex
. Alternatively, they can hold a
Miracle Seed
or
Mystic Water
for a reliable power boost.
Hapu
starts off her first battle as kahuna with her
Alolan Dugtrio
.
Sandstorm
lets it chip away its foe's health, while activating its
Sand Veil
Ability to boost its evasion. As it is part-
Steel
,
Fire
and
Fighting
moves are also effective. Grass moves are best against her
Gastrodon
and
Ice
moves are very effective against her
Flygon
. When it comes to her
Mudsdale
, avoid using physical moves: not only can it return the damage dealt with
Counter
, but its
Stamina
Ability boosts its
Defense
when it takes damage. With the
Z-Crystal
it holds, at any time Mudsdale can upgrade its
Earthquake
attack, turning it into the Ground-type Z-Move,
Tectonic Rage
. While powerful, this can fortunately be done only once.

After the battle, Hapu rewards you with the
Groundium Z
and teaches you the pose for
Tectonic Rage
. She then stamps your
Trainer Passport
with the
Poni Trial Completion
stamp. This stamp ensures that all Pokémon up to Level 80, even those received in a trade, will obey without question. She directs you and Lillie to a large cave opening to the east, encouraging the two of you to press onward to find the altar.
