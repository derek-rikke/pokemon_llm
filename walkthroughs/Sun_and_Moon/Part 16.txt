Enter

to find
Professor Kukui
being harassed by a pair of
Team Skull
Grunts. Not to be intimidated, Kukui tells them that he'll beat them in four turns in a
Battle Royal
match. Just then, someone else from Team Skull approaches and gets in the professor's face. This is
Guzma
, the leader of Team Skull. Guzma refers to the two of them as fellow rejects who could never become captains, and states that there is no need for a Pokémon League as everyone already knows the strongest Trainer on these islands. Kukui disagrees, as he chose to study Pokémon moves instead of becoming a captain. When he discovered
Z-Moves
, he knew he had to establish a Pokémon League so that every Trainer can be pushed to their limits. Guzma doesn't want to hear this and promises to destroy Kukui one day, but not before destroying everything he cares about first, and pulls you into battle.
VS Guzma
Guzma
prefers using
Bug
Pokémon, so use
Flying

Rock
attacks for best results.

Defeated, Guzma and his Team Skull Grunts run off. Kukui congratulates you on your victory and gives you a special
Z-Crystal
for your first partner Pokémon: the
Decidium Z
, the
Incinium Z
, or the
Primarium Z
. These crystals upgrade their signature moves in battle:
Spirit Shackle
becomes
Sinister Arrow Raid
,
Darkest Lariat
becomes
Malicious Moonsault
, and
Sparkling Aria
becomes
Oceanic Operetta
. He then notices the
Professor's Mask
, and says that he'll get it back to the Masked Royal safe and sound.
Lillie
and
Acerola
enter, Kukui leaves for
Mount Lanakila
to oversee the construction, and Acerola suggests tackling the next trial beyond
Route 11
. Her and Lillie then set out to do some shopping, so leave the garden and head south from the city to reach
Route 11
.
Route 11
Route 11
Route 11

Hapu and Mudsdale
Upon reaching Route 12, it is difficult not to notice the rugged, uneven ground ahead. Just then,
Hapu
and her
Mudsdale
approach from the north. They have been looking for you, and Hapu says that if you are going to be traveling around
Ula'ula Island
, then you should do it astride a Mudsdale. She registers Mudsdale Gallop in your
Ride Pager
as thanks for helping her on
Akala Island
. Calling Mudsdale allows the user to cross rocky terrain, like that of Route 12. Hapu suggests continuing on to
Tapu Village
in the southwest before she and Mudsdale turn and leave.

The Search for Cosmog
When you first approach the motel,
Hau
comes running up from behind. He heard that you cleared
Sophocles
' trial and excitedly informs you that he has done the same before giving you a
Max Potion
. Just then,
Gladion
exits the motel and says that
Team Skull
is looking for a Pokémon called
Cosmog
. According to him, Cosmog is not a very strong Pokémon, but it has the potential to summon a Pokémon so strong that it would be a disaster for the region. He continues, saying that if you know where it is, or learn any more about it, to keep it safe. Gladion leaves, and Hau wonders if
Lillie
is going to be safe with the gang looking for Nebby. He decides to take on his next trial to get even stronger, and runs off to the west.
The Shifting Sands
The entrance to
Haina Desert
is initially blocked due to the difficulty of traversing the area. The broiling sun and shifting sands make it easy to become disoriented, as traveling one way or another does not always lead where one might expect.
