Welcome to Akala
When Kukui and his passengers disembark, they are met by two young women.
Olivia
wishes good luck to you and
Hau
on your island challenge, and is looking forward to battling the two Trainers when the time comes.
Mallow
introduces herself as one of the island's trial captains, and the two leave. The professor reveals that Olivia is indeed the
Akala Island
Kahuna
, and that there are three trials on the island. He advises you that the nearest trial is located beyond
Route 4
and
Paniola Town
to the northeast. Hau leaves for the Pokémon Center, more interested in the local selection of malasadas.
Lillie
decides to do some shopping and investigate another set of ruins for Nebby. The group disperses, and Rotom unlocks a new section of the Pokédex: the
Akala Pokédex
!
Ferry Terminal
The Ferry Terminal is the first building at the end of the street. Now that you have reached Akala Island, you may take the ferry between
Hau'oli City
and
Heahea City
at any time.
Akala Tourist Bureau
Name Rater
The
Alola
region's resident
Name Rater
can be found in the Akala Tourist Bureau building, just east of the ferry terminal. This man has the power to evaluate and change your Pokémon's nicknames as often as you would like. However, he cannot change a Pokémon's nickname if it first belonged to someone else.
Apparel Shop
The apparel shop is housed inside the next building to the east.
Lillie
and
Nebby
can be found outside. Nebby is anxious to investigate the
Ruins of Life
, the home of
Akala Island
's
guardian deity
,
Tapu Lele
. Lillie invites you along, and will be waiting outside the
Tide Song Hotel
for you. She will be meeting someone there in the meantime, someone important to her... She warns you about the no-good group that has been stealing Pokémon,
Team Skull
, before scooping Nebby into her bag and heading off.
Inside the apparel shop, there is an old man, a former trial captain, to the right. He misses his former role, and offers you a makeshift trial: visit the beach near
Hano Grand Resort
on the southeast side of the island to catch a
Pyukumuku
. Speak to him again after registering the Pokémon in your Pokédex to receive a
$
10,000 reward.
The shop offers a different selection than the one in
Hau'oli City
. It sells
fashion items
, offering tops, bottoms, shoes, hats, and eyewear, as well as socks for female Trainers.

Afterward, Sina heals your Pokémon to full health. Dexio says how your battle reminded him of he and Sina in the past, and a group of five young Trainers. He rewards you with the
Zygarde Cube
, a means to collect the Cores and Cells of a Pokémon named
Zygarde
. Dexio says he will give you the details at another time, and asks that you keep the item safe for now. As they leave, he recommends heading to
Route 4
to continue your island challenge.
Inside the hotel itself, there is a mysterious green sparkle in the far left corner of the lobby. Check it, and the strange creature is sucked up into the Zygarde Cube. Just then, you receive a call from
Sina
. She explains that the creature you just found is a Zygarde Cell, and the Zygarde Cube acts as a nest for Cells and Cores. She tasks you with collecting all of the Zygarde Cells and Cores in the region, and ends the call.
Lillie can be found on the other side of the lobby. She got scared by some people who looked like
Team Skull
and ducked inside the hotel to avoid them, but ended up missing her meeting. She asks if you are headed to your next trial, and directs you to
Route 4
.

Follow the path around the first bend to battle Madame Elizabeth. A Pokémon Breeder stands at the entrance to the first paddock; recognizing you as a trial-goer, he reveals that there is a captain visiting the ranch and invites you inside.
Moomoo Paddock
It turns out to be
Mallow
, who is here to get Moomoo Milk to use in her recipes. Since she was lucky enough to run into you, she registers
Stoutland
in your
Ride Pager
. This lets you access
Stoutland Search
, which calls a Stoutland that is able to sniff out hidden items. When riding Stoutland, press the B Button to search, then press the A Button when the exclamation point above it turns red. As she leaves, Mallow suggests visiting her friend
Lana
in
Brooklet Hill
.
There is a lone
Tauros
in the paddock's northwest corner that has been behaving aggressively. Interact with it to trigger a battle with Pokémon Breeder Wesley, who rewards your victory with a
Scope Lens
. Use
Stoutland Search
to find a
Moomoo Milk
,
Fresh Water
, and
Repel
before moving on.
Southern Paddock
Head southeast to enter the first patch of tall brown grass in the eastern paddock. Use Stoutland Search to locate a hidden

, and collect the
Zygarde Cell
in the northeast corner
Day
. Climb over the dirt ramp to reach another Zygarde Cell
Night
and an
Ether
in the southwest corner. Go east to battle Pokémon Breeder Glenn and continue on to reach the Nursery.
Pokémon Nursery
The
Pokémon Nursery
is located near the junction at the eastern end of the ranch. The place is run by a pair of Pokémon Breeders, two sisters who were inspired by the
Pokémon Day Cares
in other regions. Trainers may leave two Pokémon in the Nursery to produce
Pokémon Eggs
. Pokémon that are left here will not level up, and the cost for retrieving a Pokémon is always
$
500. On your first visit, the woman behind the counter gives you a Pokémon Egg that was just recently found!
A woman inside the Nursery gives out
TM10
(
Hidden Power
), and can reveal the type of any Pokémon's Hidden Power.
