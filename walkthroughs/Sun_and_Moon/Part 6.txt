Iki Town
Iki Town
Professor Kukui
and
Lillie
are waiting for you back in
Iki Town
. The professor points out that
island kahuna
Hala
uses
Fighting-type
Pokémon, and advises using
Flying
- or
Psychic-type
moves. Avoid using
Normal
Pokémon against him, as they will take increased damage from Fighting attacks. Once he and Lillie leave, you spot Hala farther ahead near the stairway. Speak to him and he congratulates you on clearing the trial in
Verdant Cavern
. The kahuna asks if you are ready; say yes, and the two combatants walk up onto the stage.
Melemele Grand Trial
As a
Fighting-type
Pokémon specialist,
Hala
's team takes serious damage from
Flying
,
Psychic
, and
Fairy
moves. Flying Pokémon like
Rowlet
and
Pikipek
can hold a
Sharp Beak
to enhance their Flying attacks. Though not much help in battle initially,
Abra
learns the Psychic-type move
Confusion
upon its evolution into
Kadabra
.
Butterfree
resists Fighting moves and has access to both Flying- and Psychic-type attacks.
Cutiefly
can deal super-effective damage with its Fairy attacks, while its
Bug
/
Fairy
typing means that it takes only 25% damage from Fighting moves.
Hala
starts off with his
Mankey
, which tends to use
Focus Energy
to boost the high
critical hit
rate of
Karate Chop
even further. Though vulnerable to
Psychic
moves,
Pursuit
lets Mankey retaliate against Psychic Pokémon that would usually have a type advantage. Challengers should avoid landing critical hits of their own, as its
Anger Point
Ability maximizes Mankey's physical attack when hit by one.
Makuhita
's
Fake Out
causes the target to
flinch
, but may only be used on its first turn in battle. Despite
Arm Thrust
having a low base power, damage from the
multistrike move
can quickly add up. Trainers who chose
Litten
as their first Pokémon should be mindful that Makuhita's
Thick Fat
Ability lessens the damage taken from
Fire
- and
Ice-type
moves by 50%.
Crabrawler
's
Iron Fist
Ability raises its
punching
power by 20%. A boosted
Power-Up Punch
then deals extra damage and raises its
Attack
, further increasing its damage output.
Leer
lowers the target's physical
Defense
, so it sustains even more damage than normal. Like Mankey, Crabrawler can also take on Psychic Pokémon with
Pursuit
. With the
Z-Crystal
it holds, at any time Crabrawler can upgrade its Power-Up Punch move, turning it into the Fighting-type Z-Move,
All-Out Pummeling
. While powerful, this can fortunately be done only once.

After the battle, Hala tells you that he is not surprised by the outcome.
Tapu Koko
cries out in the distance, and Hala says that it may be hoping for a day when you are strong enough to battle it as well. The kahuna rewards you with the
Fightinium Z
and teaches you the pose for
All-Out Pummeling
. He then stamps your
Trainer Passport
with the
Melemele Trial Completion
stamp. This stamp ensures that all Pokémon up to Level 35, even those received in a trade, will obey without question.
The group begins to leave the stage area when Hala's
Tauros
returns. He registers the Pokémon in a
Ride Pager
, a device that lets you summon one of several Pokémon as a means of travel, and hands it to you. The device can be accessed by pressing the Y Button. Tauros Charge increases your travel speed on land, and lets you smash through large boulders by pressing the B Button. Be sure to revisit previous areas with your new-found ability before moving on from Melemele Island!
Ilima
appears and tells you that he worked on developing the Ride Pager with a friend, and hopes you find it useful. He invites you to a battle the next time you meet, and wishes you luck on the rest of your journey.
Kukui
has a gift for you as well:
TM54
(
False Swipe
). False Swipe is a restrained attack that always leaves the target with 1
HP
, which makes catching Pokémon much easier. He tells you to let
Mom
know of your plans before heading to the Marina in
Hau'oli City
.
After the others leave,
Lillie
asks for a favor.
Nebby
is far from home and she wants to help it return, but as she is not a Pokémon Trainer there is little she can do. Tell her you will help, and she resolves to set out for the next island as well.
Route 1 (Hau'oli Outskirts)
Home
Mom congratulates you on clearing the grand trial, and wishes you luck on the next island. She suggests visiting
Ten Carat Hill
before you go, as there are rare Pokémon inside.
Ten Carat Hill
Ten Carat Hill, Farthest Hollow
Located southwest of Kukui's Research Center,
Ten Carat Hill
was formed by an underwater volcano. It is famous for the open-air hollow in its center.
Cave
Pick up the
X Attack
to the right of the entrance, then head southwest. Use Tauros Charge to crash through the boulders blocking the way, then dismount to fit through the narrow path to the upper ledge. Collect the
Super Potion
to the north and
Ultra Ball
to the south, then jump down to the lower level. Break through a few more large rocks until you reach a big, heavy-looking boulder; only a
powerful Pokémon
would be able to move it. Instead, turn northward to reach the Farthest Hollow.
