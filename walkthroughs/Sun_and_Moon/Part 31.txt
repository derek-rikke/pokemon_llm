. When traveling with
Solgaleo
at night, or with
Lunala
during the day, the Legendary Pokémon's power opens the dimensional distortion into an
Ultra Wormhole
. Traveling through the wormhole leads to the Altar of the Moone
S
/ Altar of the Sunne
M
in an alternate version of
Alola
which experiences daytime at the same time as night in the real world, and vice versa. Although there is only one Legendary Pokémon involved in the main story, another
Cosmog
can be found on
Ula'ula Island
that would otherwise be undetectable from the real world.

. The area can be reached by visiting

and taking the northeast exit. The exterior ruins lead to a long, damp, underground corridor. This corridor emerges at a large lake that forms a perfect circle, like the face of a clock.

suddenly appears from its Poké Ball and roars toward the sky. This causes a vision of Lunala

to appear. Both Pokémon flicker in and out of sight as they again cry out toward the sky. The two suddenly disappear, leaving behind a
Cosmog
in their place. Simply interact with the Pokémon to take it along with you.
