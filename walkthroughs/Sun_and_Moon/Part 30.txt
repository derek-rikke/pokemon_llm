Speak to
Looker
and he summons
Anabel
. Now that all of the
Ultra Beasts
have been contained, they must report their success to
Wicke
in
Aether Paradise
. They suggest that you meet them there as well, in the secret labs on the lower floor.
Aether Paradise
B2F
Enter Secret Lab B at the far end of the hallway to find
Anabel
speaking with
Wicke
. They have been waiting for you, and on behalf of
Aether Foundation
, Wicke offers her sincere thanks to the two of you. The both of you remind her of
Looker
, who is running late. He enters a moment later, talking about some new disaster. He stopped on
Melemele Island
to get malasadas for everyone on his way here, and noticed something black and shining streaking across the sky. He is afraid it may be another Ultra Beast, but there has been no word from HQ of any more creatures and Wicke calms him down. He and Anabel have been cleared for their paid leave and are ready to start their vacation. The two thank you for your help, and before he leaves, Looker delivers your payment from HQ: a whopping
$
1,000,000!

Ten Carat Hill
Ten Carat Hill, Farthest Hollow
Located southwest of Kukui's Research Center,
Ten Carat Hill
was partly accessible after clearing the first
grand trial
. However, the area may now be fully explored due to the abilities of other
Poké Ride
Pokémon.
Cave
Head southwest and use
Tauros Charge
to crash through the large rocks blocking the way. Break through a few more rocks until you reach a boulder; only
Machamp Shove
is powerful enough to move it. This leads to a cliff in the southwest wall of the hollow, where you find a pedestal with a
Flyinium Z
. Backtrack to the boulder and enter the Farthest Hollow.
