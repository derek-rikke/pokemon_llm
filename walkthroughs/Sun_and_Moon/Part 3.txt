Alola Tourist Bureau
The
Alola Tourist Bureau
is the first building past the Beachfront. It exhibits a promotional video of the
Alola
region and hosts plenty of local goods and souvenirs.
Item Giveaway
Hau
asks the receptionist on the right about a special item giveaway for Trainers who have a Rotom Pokédex. The item turns out to be a
Poké Finder
, which allows the Pokédex to take photos of Pokémon in their native habitats. Photos may only be taken at
certain locations
, revealed when the icon on the lower screen changes to a camera. Each picture receives a rating called a "Thumbs-Up" score, which adds to a Trainer's cumulative score. As the total number increases,
several new versions
can be unlocked. Pokémon found through the Poké Finder will be registered as seen in the Pokédex. Outside, the man near the broken wall gives a short tutorial.
Loto-ID
The receptionist on the left conducts the
Loto-ID
. Once per day, Trainers can draw a Loto Ticket and check that number against the last five digits of the
OT
number of all Pokémon in their party and PC storage. Even partial matches can win a prize!

Apparel shop
The apparel shop is located to the west of the Tourist Bureau. It sells
fashion items
, offering tops, bottoms, socks, and hats.
Lillie
speaks to you before you can enter. She received a free item inside for being the 99,999th visitor, but already has one and gives the spare to you. The
Lens Case
holds colored contact lenses, allowing you to change eye color in the
fitting room
of any apparel shop. Female Trainers will also receive a
Makeup Bag
, which enables the changing of lip color.

A Beauty standing near the
Pokémon Center Café
would like to see a certain cute Pokémon, a
Drifloon
. Drifloon can be found in the nearby
Hau'oli Cemetery
. Show the Pokémon to her to receive a reward of
$
10,000.
Trouble Brewing
At the end of the street, a couple of Office Workers can be overheard discussing a group called
Team Skull
, seen loitering around the Marina. It sounds like they are looking for Pokémon to steal!
Ilima's House
Ilima
lives the house to the southwest, on the water's edge. He is not home at the moment, but you can find an
Ether
in the yard and receive a
Lumiose Galette
from his mother inside.
Hau'oli City Hall
Hau'oli City Hall is located in the Shopping District, south of the local Pokémon Center. Its motto is "Serving the city's every need!". Clerks working here deal with the process of moving to the region, amongst other things.
Malasada Shop
The city's
malasada
shop is found on the way to the Marina. It is famous for its malasadas, a type of doughnut, which are crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.
The left attendant sells Sweet Malasada for
$
200, which is immediately fed to a Pokémon and increases its
Affection
. Other shops elsewhere in Alola offer
different flavors
.
The right attendant sells
Big Malasada
for
$
350. When used from the Bag, a Big Malasada cures
confusion
and
status ailments
like
sleep
or
poison
. With high demand for the fried food, the shop sells only one to each customer per day.
Hau'oli Police Station
The Hau'oli Police Station is located in the Shopping District, a short distance from the Marina. There is a police vehicle parked in its backyard.
Marina
The Melemele Ferry Terminal is located to the south.
