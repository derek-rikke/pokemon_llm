On the third floor,
Kukui
introduces you to his wife,
Professor Burnet
. Burnet runs the laboratory, which monitors spacetime in the
Alola
region. She reveals that, three months ago, she found Lillie and Nebby unconscious on a beach. She goes on to explain the
Ultra Wormhole
phenomenon, where dimensional rifts sometimes split open in the skies over Alola. Legends of fearsome Pokémon appearing from these wormholes have led people to believe in the existence of a mysterious alternate dimension. These
Ultra Beasts
were feared, and stories claim that the
guardian deities
fought desperately against them. Burnet hopes to study dimensional disturbances in order to unravel the mystery of these Ultra Wormholes.
Speak to Lillie, and she explains that she was headed to meet with Burnet to learn more about Nebby when she got lost and collapsed on the shore. Burnet has been helping Lillie research Nebby's origin so that it can make its way home. Head to the elevator, where Kukui reminds you about challenging Kahuna
Olivia
. Burnet informs you that Olivia's house is located in
Konikoni City
, which is past
Diglett's Tunnel
to the south.
Exit the lab, and you notice something overhead. Something that looks like a crack in the sky comes into view before quickly fading away.
Hau
appears and directs you toward Diglett's Tunnel as well, before heading off for more malasada.
Diglett's Tunnel
Diglett's Tunnel
Diglett's Tunnel
connects
Heahea City

Route 9
in the south. One branch leads to an isolated area of

Dugtrio
can sometimes be seen moving through the area.

Upon entering the tunnel, you see
Olivia
speaking with a couple of
Aether Foundation Employees
. Increased activity by the local
Diglett
population had been making it difficult for travelers to reach
Konikoni City
, but they have since settled down. Realizing that she is your next opponent, Olivia invites you to meet her at her shop in Konikoni.
Take the path to the east to battle Worker Frank and collect a
Dusk Ball
. Turn around and go west, past Black Belt Greg. Use Stoutland to find two hidden items, an
Escape Rope
and an
X Attack
. Switch to Tauros and clear the rocks near the stairway to reach a
Fire Stone
. Climb the two stairways to speak with the two Aether Foundation Employees, who reveal that
Team Skull
was the reason behind the agitated
Diglett
. Follow the path around the bend for a
Hyper Potion
. Take the narrow path to the south to find a large boulder blocking a westward tunnel. Battle Worker Jeff and jump the ledge, then continue on to fight Worker Vaclav. A pair of Team Skull Grunts blocks the exit, but
Hau
appears just in time for a
Multi Battle
. Defeat them and they run off, and Hau gives you a
Max Ether
.
