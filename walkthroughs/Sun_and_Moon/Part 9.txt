Royal Avenue
Royal Avenue
began as a side road that ran along the
Battle Royal Dome
, but the venue's popularity led to the area being developed into its current appearance. The space now includes a Pokémon Center, Malasada Shop, and
Thrifty Megamart
, as well. The street connects
Route 6
in the west to
Route 7
in the northeast.

The right-side clerk at the Poké Mart offers
TM07
(
Hail
),
TM11
(
Sunny Day
),
TM18
(
Rain Dance
), and
TM37
(
Sandstorm
) for sale. These moves alter the
weather
and can be just the thing to help win a difficult battle, but at
$
50,000 each it will take some time to collect all four.
Malasada Shop
The
malasada
shop is located in the southeast part of Royal Avenue. The left attendant sells both Sour and Dry varieties for
$
200 each. Other shops elsewhere in Alola offer
different flavors
. The right attendant sells
Big Malasada
for
$
350. With high demand for the fried food, the shop sells only one Big Malasada to each customer per day.
Battle Royal Dome
Head toward the
Battle Royal Dome
to find
Gladion
, who mumbles to himself before walking inside. Follow him inside to be met by a mysterious, masked man, who introduces himself as the
Masked Royal
. His goal is to teach Trainers about the battle format that has been passed down in Alola for generations: the
Battle Royal
. Four Trainers choose three Pokémon each, then send one at a time into a free-for-all battle. When one Trainer's team is unable to continue, the battle ends. The winning Trainer is the one who has defeated the most Pokémon and also has the most remaining Pokémon.
After explaining the rules, the Masked Royal suggests a practice battle.
Hau
volunteers upon hearing this, and the Royal calls
Gladion
over to participate as well. The Masked Royal uses
Rockruff
, Gladion chooses
Type: Null
, and Hau sends in the second-stage of his
first partner Pokémon
.
Afterward in the lobby, another stranger introduces himself as
Kiawe
, the Fire captain. Having just witnessed the battle, he hopes that you bring that same fire and burn up his trial on the peak of
Wela Volcano Park
.
Thrifty Megamart
The
Thrifty Megamart
is located to the east of the Battle Royal Dome. A clerk near the entrance hands out a discount coupon, which refunds 50% of the total price of each purchase made here. The clerk at the nearest checkout lane offers only
an odd souvenir
, the center-right clerk has a selection of status-healing items, and the center-left clerk offers several different types of Poké Ball.

The
Veteran
behind the far-left counter does not offer anything for sale, but only suggests returning to him after becoming the strongest Trainer in Alola.
A clerk near the far-left counter gives out one random type of Berry per day. Possible varieties include
Tamato Berry
,
Rawst Berry
,
Oran Berry
, and
Bluk Berry
.
There is a
Hypno
standing farther back near the western door. A note on its chest indicates that it is down on its luck. Donate
$
1,000 to help him out and the costumed man rewards your generosity with
TM44
(
Rest
).
There is a boy with his
Drifloon
on the east side of the building. It turns out to be the same Drifloon that you saved from
Team Skull
on
Route 6
, and gives you a
Lemonade
as thanks.
Route 7
Route 7
Route 7
spans the northeast part of
Akala Island
. The sweltering conditions make anyone in the area begin to sweat from the heat of the volcano. The path connects
Route 6
with
Wela Volcano Park
to the west and
Route 8
to the north.

Trek through the tall grass and up the first ramp to find a
Hyper Potion
to the south. Continue up the slope to battle Sightseer Mariah. Farther to the north, there is a young woman standing near a cave entrance. She calls herself the "cutest" of the three Seismic Sisters, and informs you that the cave next to her leads directly to the top of the volcano. Exit the cave to find yourself outside the trial site. The woman at the entrance will heal your Pokémon to full health. Before heading to the peak, it is best to explore the other side of the volcano. Take the path down the left side of the mountain to find a
Zygarde Cell
, a
Charcoal
, and the "prettiest" Seismic Sister. The tunnel here leads to the right side of the volcano and the "most charming" Seismic Sister. Head down this side of the volcano to fight Ace Trainer Jim and collect
TM39
(
Rock Tomb
) on the cliff's edge. Battle Hiker Calhoun and continue down the series of ledges to reach a
Burn Heal
, then take the first tunnel again to the summit.
Captain Kiawe's Trial
Enter the Captain's Gate and climb to the peak to begin
Kiawe
's trial. He and his
Marowak
have studied the ancient dances passed down in
Alola
for generations, and his trial is meant to test the challenger's powers of observation. There will be one dance performance, then another, and the challenger must identify the difference between them.
For the first set of dances, the correct answer is the middle Pokémon, though any answer given results in a battle with Marowak.

VS Totem Salazzle
When the battle begins, the Totem
Salazzle
is surrounded by an aura that raises its
Special Defense
by one stage. As in other trials, it is recommended to focus on the Totem Pokémon first and any allies afterward. Salazzle has a unique
Fire
/
Poison
typing and a signature Ability,
Corrosion
. This lets it use
Toxic
to
badly poison
any Pokémon, even
Poison
and
Steel
types that would normally be immune. Adding insult to injury,
Venom Drench
then lowers the
Attack
,
Special Attack
, and
Speed
of a poisoned target by one stage. Taking Salazzle down quickly with super-effective damage is the key to avoiding any lingering ailments.
Wishiwashi
of level 20 or more has access to the increased stats of its School Form, and like
Brionne
, can deal serious damage with
Waterium Z
and
Hydro Vortex
. Other viable options include the Ground-type
Mudbray
and the Psychic-type
Kadabra
. Use
Ground
-,
Rock
-,
Water
-, and
Psychic-type
attacks for best results.

After the Totem Pokémon and its allies are defeated, Kiawe rewards you with the
Firium Z
and teaches you the pose for
Inferno Overdrive
. He also gives you ten
Quick Balls
and registers a new service in your Ride Pager—
Charizard Glide
! Summoning Charizard will let you quickly return to any area visited previously. Try it out now and use Charizard to fly back to
Route 7
. Speak to the trial guide near the gate and proceed north to
Route 8
.
Having registered Charizard Glide in the Ride Pager, it is now possible to visit
Poké Pelago
. Accessed through the menu, Pokémon stored in the PC can visit these islands to relax and play.
