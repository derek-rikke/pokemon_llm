Malie City
The Aether ship delivers its passengers to
Malie City
on
Ula'ula Island
, the southeastern of the four major islands. Ula'ula is even larger than
Akala Island
, with many different places to visit and Pokémon to catch. Malie City's Eastern architecture was inspired by designs from the faraway
Johto
region. The city features a sprawling garden, a high-class restaurant, a library, several shops, and even a recycling plant on the cape.

Afterward, Hau runs off to meet

in

. Before you can follow, Rotom informs you that a new subsection of Pokédex has been unlocked to accommodate the Pokémon found on
Ula'ula Island
. Go west from the Pokémon Center to find the road blocked by
Lillie
, who reminds you to visit the garden to the north.
Malie Garden
Malie Garden
A well-manicured garden in the middle of the city,
Malie Garden
was designed by immigrants from the
Johto
region and features an Eastern style like the rest of the city. A popular tourist spot, a tea shop is located here to serve the many visitors.

Catch Up with Kukui
Hau begins his search for the professor at the bridge north of the entrance, leaving you to explore the edges of the garden. When you reach the tea shop, you find
Kukui
sitting outside. Hau excitedly informs him of the events involving the
Ultra Wormhole
and
Ultra Beasts
. Kukui points to that as a great reason to train even harder on the island challenge, and wonders if one day it will be possible to travel through the wormhole. He then informs the two Trainers that their next trial is located atop
Mount Hokulani
, which can be reached from the bus stop on
Route 10
to the west. Hau insists on visiting the malasada shop first, so the professor leaves to wait for you on Route 10.
The Other Professor
Leave the garden and turn west.
Lillie
is headed to the Malie Library, and asks if you would help her to find a certain book. She sets off to the west, leaving you to follow. A moment later, you are greeted by someone that Rotom Dex refers to as "Professor". The man introduces himself as
Samson Oak
, a researcher who studies the
regional variants
of certain Pokémon species. He is off to the library as well, so you may chat with him there.
Malasada Shop
Continue west past the next road to reach the
malasada
shop. The left attendant sells both Spicy and Bitter varieties for
$
200 each. The right attendant sells
Big Malasada
for
$
350. Like with other locations, high demand forces the shop to limit the fried food to one per customer each day.
Sushi High Roller
Further west of the malasada shop is a high-class restaurant called Sushi High Roller. Z-Kaiseki meals can be purchased here for
$
4,000. After each meal, the customer receives four complimentary
Heart Scales
.
Time for a Trade
A female Sightseer at the table in the southeast corner is looking for a
Pancham
, and offers to trade her
Happiny
for one.
Salon
The salon is located to the north of the restaurant, and offers the usual cut and color services to travelers in need of a fresh haircut.
Apparel Shop
The apparel shop stands between the salon and the western wall of Malie Garden. It offers tops, bottoms, shoes, bags, hats, and eyewear, as well as socks for female customers.

Malie Community Center
The Community Center is located to the west of Malie Garden. A girl in the sitting area will give your lead Pokémon a
Best Friends Ribbon
if it has maximum
Affection
. Two rooms down the hallway contain a class on
weather
effects and a
flea market
.
Malie Library
Go north to find Lillie outside the library. A
Mudsdale
suddenly runs up to her, with
Hapu
close behind. Realizing Lillie is no trial-goer, Hapu asks what she is doing here. Lillie mentions that she is studying the Tapu's ruins, and Hapu offers to lead the way whenever she likes. Hapu and Mudsdale leave, and you follow Lillie inside the building.
1F
Lillie tells you that the book she is looking for is very old, and contains information on the myths and legends that she heard about from
Professor Burnet
. These tales seem to suggest that
Alola
's Legendary Pokémon came from another world. She heads upstairs, leaving you to explore on your own.
The woman at the center table is from
Johto
, where Trainers teach their Pokémon to
Fly
with a
Hidden Machine
. That's not necessary in Alola, where the move is relegated to
TM76
, an item that she hands over as thanks for teaching her something new.
Samson Oak
can be found in the back corner on the first floor. He explains a bit more about regional variants, and mentions that he'd like to see one of the local
Persians
. Speak to him with an Alolan Persian in your party to receive a
Love Ball
.
2F
Upstairs, Lillie is still looking for her book, until a purple-haired girl points out that it is laying open on the table. Lillie reads aloud
The Light of Alola
, which references beasts of sun and moon that appeared from a wormhole and battled with the island guardians.
Acerola
mentions that the book had belonged to her father, and that her family was once royalty. Lillie stays behind to learn more from her, and wishes you luck on your upcoming
Electric-type
trial.

North of the library is the city's outer cape. Speak to the Janitors outside the Recycling Plant, and they explain how they collect garbage for
Grimer
and
Muk
to eat. The boss of the plant, Janitor Shawn, then challenges you to a battle. After defeating him, he asks you to battle his son, Ace Trainer Chase. After that second battle, Shawn is proud of his son for trying, and makes him the head of the plant. He then gives you a
Twisted Spoon
as thanks.
Meet Gester
There is an old man in front of the building who introduces himself as
Gester
. A choreographer, he teaches different battle styles to interested Trainers, and lets them change their style to any they have learned. Battle styles are the name for a Trainer's pose when first sending out a Pokémon at the start of battle. There are
eight different styles
in all.
