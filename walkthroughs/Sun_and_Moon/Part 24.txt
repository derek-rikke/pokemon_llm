Approaching the Altar
When you exit the tunnel from
Vast Poni Canyon
,
Lillie
,
Hapu
, and Mudsdale are right behind you. Hapu commends you on clearing your latest trial; Lillie is excited for you having now cleared all seven trials of
Alola
's island challenge, and heals your Pokémon. Climb the grand staircase to reach the altar.
The Ceremony
When you reach the top of the staircase, it is time to begin the ceremony. Lillie takes her place on one side of the altar, on a platform surrounded by water. Head to the opposite side to take your place, as well. When the
Sun Flute
and
Moon Flute
are played, the pools of water react and activate the altar. A doorway opens and shoots a massive beam of light at the central platform, which draws Nebby into it. Lillie looks on in amazement as Nebby evolves into
Solgaleo

/
Lunala
M
! She pleads with Nebby to see her mother, so the Legendary Pokémon uses the power of its third eye to open an
Ultra Wormhole
and carries you and Lillie into
Ultra Space
.
Ultra Space
Ultra Space
After reaching this
interdimensional
area,
Lillie
realizes that Nebby must stay in this spot; if you need to prepare, speak with it to return to your own world.
Follow Lillie northward through the undersea-like area to find
Guzma
. The
Team Skull
boss may be scared of nothing and nobody, but warns you of the danger of the
Ultra Beasts
after revealing that he had been possessed by one. He states that
Lusamine
has lost her mind over these beasts, and there is no reasoning with her. Follow Lillie to the end of the path to be confronted by several Ultra Beasts; when they disappear, Lusamine appears in their place. She becomes enraged that you would dare to come to her beautiful world. Lillie tries to reason with her, but it's no use. Lusamine releases her
Nihilego
from its Beast Ball and the two merge to form a shadowy, jellyfish-like creature, and the battle begins!
VS Lusamine
Each of
Lusamine
's Pokémon has an aura that boosts one of its stats, and each has a move that can restore its health.
Poison-type
moves are useful against her
Clefable
and
Lilligant
, while
Flying
attacks deal serious damage to Lilligant and
Bewear
.
Mismagius
falters against
Ghost
and
Dark
moves;
Milotic
is vulnerable to
Grass
- and
Electric-type
attacks.

When the battle ends, Lusamine attempts to attack on her own. Lillie calls for Nebby's help, and it uses the power of its third eye to repel Lusamine's assault. She and
Nihilego
split, and her Pokémon returns to its Beast Ball as she falls to the ground. Lillie runs to her mother's side as a group of Nihilego appears and prepares to attack. The Legendary Pokémon rushes in and teleports everyone, including Lusamine and
Guzma

Hapu
was concerned and came looking for you, only to find a Legendary Pokémon and a strange hole in the sky, and is relieved to see you both unhurt. She believes that Lusamine will recover and tells Guzma to lift her onto Mudsdale's back. The three set off to get the woman some medical attention. Nebby indicates that it wants to continue traveling with you and Lillie, but she can't give it the fierce battles that it wants, she asks that you face it as only a Trainer can.

Throwing the
Master Ball
at the start of the battle is the easiest way to go, but if that is not an option, you will need to treat Nebby as any other wild Pokémon. Begin with
Ghost
- and
Dark-type
moves to wear its health down quickly, then follow-up with less effective attacks.
Solgaleo
's
Full Metal Body
Ability prevents stat reduction;
Lunala
's
Shadow Shield
Ability reduces the damage taken at full health. It signature move,

, deals damage while ignoring the target's Ability. If defeated or run from, the Legendary Pokémon respawns without you needing to leave the area.

Afterward, Lillie is overjoyed at having seen Nebby in battle and entrusts the Pokémon to you. After a few parting words to the both of you, she sets off to check on her mother.
One Trial Remains
Once Lillie has left,
Nanu
appears. Now that you have completed all of the island trials and grand trials, there's only one trial left: defeating the kahunas, four of
Alola
's elite Trainers, all in a row. Things are different this year, as Alola is getting its own
Pokémon League
. He suggests that you visit
Mount Lanakila
on
Ula'ula Island
, and invites you to travel with him to
Tapu Village
at the foot of the mountain.
