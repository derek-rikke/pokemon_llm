The Mysterious Scientist
Leave the

building and proceed to the west, and a moment later you are stopped by a Scientist who introduces himself as
Colress
. He is researching the bonds that bring out a Pokémon's potential, and so is very interested in Trainers who have a Z-Ring. To mark the encounter, he gives you
TM43
(
Flame Charge
) and encourages you to make use of it at the next trial in
Lush Jungle
.
Fossil Restoration Center
The path to the northeast of the Pokémon Center leads to a small wooded area with a trailer. A Pokémon Breeder here describes his dream of bringing ancient Pokémon back to life. Bring him any
Fossil
and he will be able to revive it into a Pokémon.
Roadside Motel
The Roadside Motel is located to the west of the Pokémon Center, on a cliff overlooking the ocean. A vending machine near the front desk holds
Fresh Water
and
Soda Pop
for sale. The receptionist reveals that a member of
Team Skull
has been staying in the building. It turns out to be
Gladion
, who does not take kindly to visitors.
Lush Jungle
Lush Jungle
Located to the north of
Route 5
,
Lush Jungle
is a dense rainforest famous for producing ingredients for delicious meals. It serves as the backdrop for the next trial.
Wild Pokémon
cannot be found until the trial is complete.

Captain Mallow's Trial
Mallow
welcomes you upon entering the jungle, and enlists your help in finding four ingredients to cook up her favorite dish, the Mallow Special. To do so, she needs a
Mago Berry
,
Tiny Mushroom
,
Revival Herb
, and a
Miracle Seed
. She gives you a
Forage Bag
to hold any ingredients collected, and hints that
Stoutland Search
will be useful in locating these items. As with other trials, wild Pokémon cannot be found until the trial is complete.
Call Stoutland and go west to find some mushrooms. Collect the
Tiny Mushroom
, and the Big Mushroom attacks! It turns out to be a (
Parasect
S
/
Shiinotic
M
). Once it is defeated, Mallow congratulates you and reminds you that there are still three more ingredients to find. Take Stoutland north to the next area.
Northwest area
Have Stoutland search near the small tree in the tall grass patch to find a hidden
X Sp. Atk
. There is a Photo Spot to the west, as well. Continue westward along the path to reach a rustling tree, where you are suddenly attacked by a
Fomantis
! After the battle, you can find the
Mago Berry
buried in the ground. Mallow stops by to congratulate you again, and reminds you about the two remaining ingredients. Go back to the previous area.
Central area
Go east through the nearest tall grass patch. Use Stoutland to find a hidden
X Defense
in the eastern grass patch, then dismount to reach a
Super Potion
behind a narrow path to the northwest. Continue north to the next area.
North area
Take the eastern path to find a hidden
Hyper Potion
, then head west. Use Stoutland to search the tall grasses to the west and locate the
Revival Herb
to the southwest. Once it is safely tucked away, another
Fomantis
leaps from the grass to attack! Afterward, Mallow reappears a third time. Only one ingredient remains! Farther to the west is a narrow path that leads to
TM86
(
Grass Knot
). In the grassy area to the north, Stoutland can reveal a hidden
Heal Powder
.
Central area
Head south on the east side of the main area. Go up the hill in the southeast to the next part of the jungle.
East area
Collect the
X Attack
from the curled fronds to the east of the first cracked rock. A
large boulder
blocks the path eastward for now. Go southwest instead and use Tauros to clear the path of rocks. The final ingredient, a
Miracle Seed
, can be found in the depression where one of the rocks used to sit. Mallow appears once more to congratulate you on finding all of the ingredients. It is time to start cooking, so head back to the jungle entrance. Use the path westward from the Miracle Seed to jump down the ledges and find a
Big Root
along the way.
Central area
When you speak with Mallow,
Lana
and
Kiawe
appear. They have each brought items to help with the preparation. With all ingredients accounted for, you and Mallow begin cooking. Press A repeatedly to grind the food to a pulp. Suddenly, you feel a piercing gaze from the underbrush, and the Totem Pokémon attacks!
VS Totem Lurantis
The Totem Pokémon begins surrounded by an aura that raises its
Speed
by one stage. Like other
Grass-type
Pokémon,
Lurantis
is most at home in the sunlight. Under intense sunlight, its
Leaf Guard
Ability prevents status ailments,
Synthesis
restores more health than normal, and
Solar Blade
does not require a turn to charge.
Fire
Pokémon are especially useful against Lurantis, as they resist its Grass and Bug moves, and deal serious damage with Fire attacks. If Trumbeak is present, it can cover most of Lurantis' weaknesses with
Rock Blast
, and cut the target's
Defense
with
Screech
. If Castform is present, it can set up intense sunlight with
Sunny Day
. Despite this being helpful to Lurantis, it also gives a power boost to Fire attacks. A Pokémon holding Firium Z should be able to make short work of the Totem Pokémon with Inferno Overdrive. Use
Fire
-,
Flying
-,
Ice
-,
Poison
-, or
Bug-type
attacks for best results.

After the Totem Pokémon and its allies are defeated, the three captains of Akala congratulate you on completing all of the island's trials.
Mallow
rewards you with the
Grassium Z
and teaches you the pose for
Bloom Doom
. That's not all, as she also gives you ten
Nest Balls
. Mallow invites
Lana
and
Kiawe
to try the food that
Lurantis
did not finish, but it turns out to be too spicy and the other captains run off. As she races after them, Mallow reminds you to challenge Kahuna
Olivia
's grand trial next.
Professor Kukui
appears and gives you
TM67
(
Smart Strike
) as a reward for clearing Mallow's trial. There is a facility that he wants you to check out, called the Dimensional Research Lab. He leads you back out to
Route 5
, where he congratulates you on clearing all of
Akala Island
's trials. Kahuna Olivia is an expert on
Rock-type
Pokémon, and he suggests catching some
Grass
Pokémon in
Lush Jungle
before continuing on. When you are ready to challenge Olivia, visit with Kukui in the Dimensional Research Lab in
Heahea City
, just off of
Route 6
.
Route 5 (North)
The north end of
Route 5
sits at a higher elevation than the south end, with a series of ledges that hinder northbound travel.
