The following day, as you and mom are enjoying another Alolan day
S
/night
M
, the doorbell rings again. Mom asks you to open the door, only for
Kukui
to let himself in again. He's here to take you to the festival in
Iki Town
, but now that you have your own Pokémon, there is something he would like to show you first. The professor leaves to wait outside for you. Instead of traveling west, head east this time and follow the path northward.
Route 1
Route 1
Kukui is waiting near a patch of
tall grass
, where he and his
Rockruff
demonstrate how to catch a Pokémon. After the tutorial, he gives you ten
Poké Balls
and five
Potions
to prepare you for your travels. You are now free to explore the route, and begin catching Pokémon of your own!
Route 1
is largely divided into three parts—the area near your house; the northeast cliffs overlooking the bay; and the path near Iki Town. The wild Pokémon species found in these areas vary by location, as do their levels. Before the festival in
Iki Town
, wild Pokémon cannot break out of the
Poké Balls
thrown at them.

After you've caught the Pokémon you like, make your way through the route. Behind the second patch of grass, you can find a
Potion
. Ahead, you can fight
Youngster
Jimmy and
Lass
Audrey. Behind the patch of grass near Lass Audrey, you can find a
Poké Ball
. There's also a fence on a small ledge. Walk around it and you can find an
Antidote
. At the intersection, you'll notice there are three paths to take. However, the path north and south are blocked off, so take the path westward. Behind the patch of grass, you can find another Potion. Ahead, you can fight
Preschooler
Oliver. Behind the last patch of grass, you can find a
Paralyze Heal
.
When you're finished exploring, head north to
Iki Town
.
Iki Town
Iki Town
As you enter
Iki Town
,
Hala
approaches you. He explains that the
Alola
region is made up of four islands, each with its own
guardian Pokémon
. The festival held here is meant to express thanks to the guardians for their protection.
Rival Battle 2
Hau
can be found a short distance ahead, while
Kukui
and
Lillie
arrive a moment later. Kukui explains that during the friendly competition, people battle in the name of
Melemele Island
's guardian,
Tapu Koko
. Hau cannot wait to battle, but
Hala
takes a moment to heal your Pokémon first. The
kahuna
delivers a few remarks before you and Hau step up onto the stage.
Hau has caught a
Pichu
since your last battle with him. Its
Static
Ability can
paralyze
your Pokémon if they make contact, in which case the
Paralyze Heal
from earlier will help. Hit his
first partner Pokémon
with supereffective moves to deal extra damage.

After the battle,
Tapu Koko
can be heard in the distance in a cry of approval. Hala then equips you with a
Z-Ring
, fashioned from the
Sparkling Stone
he borrowed. This bracelet is said to draw out the power that lies deep within a Pokémon, known as its
Z-Power
, but requires a
Z-Crystal
to function. He believes that Tapu Koko has a mission for you, and the kahuna and the professor encourage to you begin your
island challenge
. Kukui says that he will explain more a bit later, so for now he and
Lillie
accompany you back to your home.

, the doorbell rings again. It's not the professor this time, but
Lillie
. It seems that
Kukui
sent her to show you the way to his Pokémon Research Lab. Before you can leave,
Mom
walks outside and gives you
$
30,000 to see you on your way.
Head south across the street and down the hill. Here, Lillie informs you that
Nebby
is a
Cosmog
, a rare Pokémon from far away, and that it once saved her from
a group of people
who want it for its power. Since only those she trusts knows about Nebby, she asks that you keep it and the events at Plank Bridge a secret. She goes on ahead, so follow her southward to find the Research Lab on the beach.
Pokémon Research Lab
Lillie
is waiting outside the lab. Inside,
Kukui
asks to see your
Pokédex
for a moment, and upgrades it with new parts that were just delivered. With this upgrade, the Pokémon
Rotom
, which has a body similar to electricity, can inhabit the Pokédex and act as a virtual assistant, resulting in the
Rotom Pokédex
.
Hau
arrives, and Kukui goes on to explain the
island challenge
—Trainers must travel the four islands and clear seven trials before challenging the four kahunas to battle. The professor hands you and island challenge amulet, which you attach to your Bag, and directs you to the Trainers' School to learn the basics of Pokémon training.
Outside, head back north to the main road and turn west to find Lillie. She leads you inside the
Pokémon Center
and explains the services offered. The nurse at the counter will heal a Trainer's Pokémon to full health for free. The
PC
on the counter is always available for Trainers to organize their Pokémon.
Poké Marts
offer a wide range of items for sale, from
Potions
to
Poké Balls
. Finally, the
Pokémon Center Café
sells various drinks, which come with a free item and some
Poké Beans
with your first drink order of the day.
At this point, several new Menu options are now available: Quick Link, which allows trading and battling over a local Wi-Fi network, and
Festival Plaza
, which does the same for players worldwide. The Plaza also enables access to the
GTS
, where Trainers can search for or offer specific Pokémon to trade; and
Wonder Trade
, where Trainers can send a Pokémon off to a random Trainer somewhere around the world and receive a random Pokémon in return.
QR Scanner
and
Battle Video
have now been added as well.
Leave the Pokémon Center and head west to find Lillie. A
Tauros
blocks the road farther west, so follow her inside the Trainers' School instead.

Kukui
introduces you to one of their
Teachers
. She intends for you to battle four of her students to gain some real-world experience. Kukui gives you the
Exp. Share
, a very useful item that will distribute the
experience points
earned from every battle among your entire party, even to Pokémon that did not participate. Visit the school to brush up on the basics; the left room on the second floor is particularly full of useful books and blackboard notes.
Explore the grounds to take on the teacher's challenge. Lillie will heal your Pokémon whenever you speak with her.

After defeating Rising Star Joseph, he rewards you with

Great Balls
as a reward. Kukui and another man, who introduces himself as
Captain
Ilima
, arrive soon after. Ilima welcomes you to
Alola
and says that he will be looking forward to you taking on his trial, then leaves. The entire school gathers to see you off, and Lillie decides to show you more of the city. Unfortunately, that wayward
Tauros
still acts as a roadblock.
Hau
and
Hala
are there, and the latter requests you pat Tauros first. The Pokémon is calmed and Hala leads Tauros away, leaving you free to head into
Hau'oli City
with Lillie and Hau.
