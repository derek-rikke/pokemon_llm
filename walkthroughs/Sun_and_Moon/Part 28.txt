With the main adventure complete, you find yourself back in your room. Inspect the purple sparkle to collect the
Zygarde Core
and receive a message from
Sina
explaining what it can do. Go into the kitchen and
Hau
arrives with gifts from his grandfather. Where Kukui once gave you the Z-Crystal meant for your
first partner Pokémon
, Hau is here to deliver the two other crystals to you. As he leaves, he promises to train at the
Battle Tree
on
Poni Island
to get stronger before visiting
Lillie
and his father in
Kanto
.
When you step outside, a mysterious man gives you an
Enigmatic Card
. He advises you to take care when you read it, as no one is to know of his visit or this card. Written inside is a request for you to visit a guest room in the motel on
Route 8
on
Akala Island
.
Akala Island
Route 8
Two members of the
International Police
, "
Looker
" and his boss
Anabel
, are waiting inside the nearest room. The two are part of a secret division called the UB Task Force. Looker asks if you have encountered UB-01 Symbiont, otherwise known as
Nihilego
, and Anabel explains that the International Police refers to all Ultra Beasts by codenames. Confirm that you have indeed encountered the creature, and Anabel warns that the following info is highly classified: Symbiont was not the only Ultra Beast to appear from the Ultra Wormhole opened by
Lusamine
. They have confirmed the presence of another Symbiont, and have received reports of sightings of several other species of Ultra Beasts. These dangerous beings were suddenly dropped into our world, and should the creatures become combative, their orders are to eliminate them. As they are still living creatures, she and Looker would rather protect them from harm instead, leaving capture as their only option. They do not have the power to do this on their own, which is why they have asked for your assistance. Agree to join the Task Force, and Anabel requests a battle to test your strength.

Once you have proven your worth, the two suggest that you visit

Take the elevator down to B2F and go east to find Wicke. She thanks you for what you have done for
Lillie
and
Lusamine
, and reveals that Lillie asked her to explain why she left for
Kanto
. Lusamine's fusion with
Nihilego
reminded Lillie about a book she once read, about a man named
Bill
who created the PC Storage System. It turns out that he also wound up fused with a Pokémon in an experiment that went awry, and Lillie is hopeful that Bill's solution will also work for Lusamine. Afterward, Wicke gives you two
Big Malasadas
and returns to work.
Visit the eastern hallway and enter Secret Lab A. Speak to the Aether Employee here to receive several
Legendary artifacts
: the
DNA Splicers
, the
Prison Bottle
, and a
Soul Dew
. Exit the room and continue on to Secret Lab B to receive ten
Beast Balls
from Wicke, then return to the motel on
Route 8
.
Akala Island
Route 8
Shortly after you return,
Looker
rushes into the room. Another UB-01 Symbiont has been spotted on
Akala Island
! This begins the first UB Mission.
Wela Volcano Park / Diglett's Tunnel
A single specimen has been sighted in
Wela Volcano Park
and
Diglett's Tunnel
. Fly to either location and travel around until the creature appears in a random encounter. The creature respawns immediately if defeated or run from.

With the first mission complete, return to
Route 8
and report to Looker. Anabel informs you that the original plan was for the police force to take possession of the
Ultra Beasts
, but she has obtained clearance for you to keep them instead so they do not end up as research subjects. Looker returns to the room, excited to report the sighting of another creature on
Melemele Island
. Anabel leaves to set up a new base of operations in the local motel and asks that you meet them there.
Melemele Island
Route 2
Speak with
Anabel
to learn that she will be meeting a mysterious man with knowledge of the Ultra Beast.
Nanu
enters the room, and it is clear that he and Anabel know each other. He has information to suggest that there are multiple specimens involved in this latest sighting. He leaves before
Looker
returns and confirms Nanu's intel. Before you leave, Looker gives you another ten
Beast Balls
from
Wicke
. Visit
Melemele Meadow
to find two individuals codenamed UB-02 Absorption
S
, or
Verdant Cavern
to find four individuals codenamed UB-02 Beauty
M
. Like with UB-01, each of these creatures respawn immediately if defeated or run from.

Report back to Looker and he calls Anabel back to the room. She is feeling a bit light-headed from the last mission, so Looker suggests eating something and runs off to make restaurant reservations. When he returns, he reports another Ultra Beast sighting on
Akala Island
. Anabel asks that you meet them at their former base in the
Route 8
motel.
