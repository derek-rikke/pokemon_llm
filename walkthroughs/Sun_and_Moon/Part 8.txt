A Stranger Appears
Follow the path to the northwest to meet up with
Hau
. He seems to have just lost a battle against an angry-looking young man who introduces himself as
Gladion
. His goal is to make his partner,
Null
, as strong as it can be, while also doing small jobs for
Team Skull
. He immediately challenges you to a battle.

After the battle, he talks about not being strong enough when two Team Skull Grunts approach from the north. They taunt Gladion, blaming him for their failure in stealing the
Totem Pokémon
from
Brooklet Hill
. One of the Grunts reminds him that he will never really be part of Team Skull, and the pair leaves with Gladion following in silence. Hau gives you three
Revives
and heads off to continue training for the next trial.
Pokémon Center
For Science
A Scientist can be found near the Café. He is investigating
Brooklet Hill
and the effects of water quality on Pokémon, and asks that you catch a
Feebas
from there. Speak with him after registering the fish in the Pokédex to receive a
$
3,000 reward.
Time for a Trade
A young man named Kihei is standing to the left of the front desk. He is looking for a
Lillipup
, and is willing to trade his
Bounsweet
for one. As a
Grass-type
Pokémon, Bounsweet will be helpful when challenging the next trial. His Pokémon arrives holding a
Bright Powder
.
Brooklet Hill
Brooklet Hill
Brooklet Hill
is the best fishing spot in all of Alola. The cascading waterfalls make the area look like a terrace field.

A Mysterious Disturbance
Enter the area to meet Captain
Lana
, who immediately asks for your help. Follow her across the first lake and pick up the
Net Ball
to the south, near Fisherman Ernest.
At the second lake, Lana directs your attention to some unknown creature splashing furiously. Believing a fearsome Pokémon to be the cause, she asks you to swim out to investigate and registers
Lapras Paddle
in your Ride Pager. While surfing on Lapras, pressing the B Button results in a speed boost. Grab the
X Sp. Atk
on the north side of the lake near Backpacker Mikiko before wading out into the water. Investigate the splashing to see the shadows of several fish Pokémon flee the scene; check it again to be attacked by a
Wishiwashi
. After the battle, Lana is surprised that such a small fish could make such big waves. She then notices another commotion farther ahead, so exit the lake to the southwest. Collect the
Revive
at the Photo Spot and continue southward as the storm clouds move in.
Sail across the third lake to investigate this latest disturbance. Like the previous encounter, the first interaction scares off most of the fish Pokémon, leaving only a single Wishiwashi to battle. The rainstorm begins in earnest, and Lana still seems unconvinced that the little fish could be behind all of the splashing. She then hears even more frenzied splashing, which sounds "as big as a
Wailord
", and runs off. Surf to the secluded southeast area to find
TM55
(
Scald
), then follow her to the southwest. She reminds you that the
falling rain
boosts the power of
Water-type
moves before running ahead.
Captain Lana's Trial
Step inside the Captain's Gate to enter the Totem's Den and officially begin
Lana
's trial. She tasks you with defeating the Totem Pokémon and directs you to another disturbance out in the water. She also reminds you that wild Pokémon cannot be caught until the trial is cleared. The Totem's
Water-type
moves receive a power boost in the rain, but Pokémon with the
Cloud Nine
Ability, like
Psyduck
, can cancel such weather effects. Lapras trembles in fear, smaller shadows combine to form a large creature under the waves, and the Totem Pokémon attacks!
VS Totem Wishiwashi
The great fish begins with increased stats in its School Form due to its
Schooling
Ability, and is surrounded by an aura that further raises its
Defense
by one stage. With higher stats and a power boost from the
rain
,
Water Gun
can deal some serious damage. Totem
Wishiwashi
may be formidable in its School Form, but when its health falls below 25% it reverts to Solo Form and loses its heightened stats. If Alomomola is present, use weaker moves to chip away at Totem Wishiwashi's health then a stronger attack to knock it out. The Totem Pokémon may survive a strong attack at full health, giving Alomomola a chance to restore its health and its School Form with
Heal Pulse
. Use
Grass
- and
Electric-type
attacks for best results.

After the Totem Pokémon and its allies are defeated, the storm clouds disappear and you return to shore. Lana rewards you with the
Waterium Z
and teaches you the pose for
Hydro Vortex
. That's not all, as she also gives you a handmade
Fishing Rod
and ten
Dive Balls
. To use the rod, look for piles of rocks under the water and press the A Button to cast the line; press the A Button again when an exclamation point appears. Items may sometimes be reeled in instead of Pokémon. Lana offers to accompany you back to the Pokémon Center on
Route 5
, and directs you to
Kiawe
's trial next, in
Wela Volcano Park
.
Route 5 (South)
Outside the Pokémon Center, Lana reminds you of the pair of
Sudowoodo
blocking the path south from
Paniola Ranch
, saying that you should be able to scare them away with your new Waterium Z. Rest at the Pokémon Center if needed, then head southeast to return to the ranch.
Paniola Ranch
Continue south to meet the pair of
Sudowoodo
blocking the path. They run off without a fight toward the Battle Royal Dome. As thanks for clearing the road, the little boy standing nearby will give you a
Mystic Water
. Continue south to Route 6.
Route 6
Route 6
Route 6
is a plain, straight street that runs through the middle of
Akala Island
. It links
Paniola Ranch
in the north with
Heahea City
in the south. The
Royal Avenue
complex stands to the east. An isolated part of
Paniola Town
can be accessed to the west.

and leaves one opponent to you while she takes on the other.
After defeating them, the Grunts quickly flee after Hapu's threat to let Mudsdale stomp them. She thanks you for your help, and suggests checking out the
