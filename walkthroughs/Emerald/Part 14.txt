Route 124
holds all sorts of treasure, but most lie on the ocean floor far below. It's not possible to fully explore the area without
a certain field move
, so for now the route simply serves as a connector between
Lilycove
to the west,
Route 126
to the south, and
Mossdeep City
to the east.

Mossdeep City
Mossdeep City
stands perched on an island near
Hoenn
's eastern edge, where the winds are mild and the weather conditions are stable. This makes it the perfect place for launching rockets, and a perfect home for the
Mossdeep Space Center
. The
seventh Gym
in the
Hoenn League
, run by twin Gym Leaders, is located on the north side of the island, and
Steven
's house can be found on the island's northwest corner.

Move Tutor
The first person you meet upon arriving in Mossdeep is a Black Belt in the shallow water on the island's southwest side. As a
Fighting-type
Trainer, he's had a difficult time at the local Gym and has resorted to punching the ground to relieve his frustration. Speak to him, and he offers to teach the move
DynamicPunch
to a Pokémon, one time only.
Steven's House
The house on the island's northwest edge belongs to
Steven
, and contains part of his rock collection.
Game Corner
A Game Corner is located to the south of the Poké Mart. Inside, Trainers can compete with others from
Hoenn
E
and
Kanto
FR
LG
in two mini-games,
Pokémon Jump
and
Dodrio Berry Picking
. Communications are made using the
Game Boy Advance Wireless Adapter
.
Running Errands
Visit the house nearest the stairway to the Space Center to meet a young woman who uses a
Wingull
to send letters to a friend in
Fortree City
. Talk to the Wingull and it will take flight, off to deliver another note. If you return to Fortree and visit the Pokémon Breeder in the northeast house there, he will give you a
Mental Herb
that his Wingull found in its travels.

Score the Super Rod
The house overlooking the Gym belongs to a lone Fisherman. Speak to him to receive the
Super Rod
, a high-end fishing rod that can reel in all kinds of sea life.
Mossdeep Space Center
The
Mossdeep Space Center
stands on a hill in the northeast.
Steven
is inside, standing near a table with a letter emblazoned with the
Team Magma
logo. It seems that the group has announced its intention of stealing all the rocket fuel on the island. He plans to keep an eye on things for now, and suggests checking out the rest of the city. A Sailor near the viewing area will give you a
Sun Stone
he found on the beach.
Mossdeep Gym
Mossdeep Gym
Mossdeep City Pokémon Gym
Leaders: Liza & Tate
The mystic combination!
The
Mossdeep Gym
specializes in
Psychic-type
Pokémon, which are vulnerable to
Dark
- and
Ghost-type
moves. Dark Pokémon are both immune to Psychic moves and able to inflict super-effective damage. Three of the gym leaders' Pokémon have additional weaknesses to
Water
and
Grass
. While they're also weak to
Bug
, Bug attacks are generally too weak to be worthwhile. The Gym features several rooms linked only by
warp tiles
. Each room contains Trainers and obstacles on
spin tiles
that rotate when certain tiles are stepped on, changing the path and often bringing challengers within view of opposing Gym Trainers.
Step on the warp tile on the west side of the first room. Begin a battle with Hex Maniac Kathleen and Gentleman Clifford. Go east and step on the purple tile, and then battle Psychic Macey. Continue south and step on the green tile twice; this spins the obstacles in the south-central room. Take the north warp to the west-central room, then the left warp there to the northwest room. Step on the first blue tile twice, battle Gentleman Nate and Psychic Virgil, step on the orange tile three times, battle Hex Maniac Sylvia and Psychic Hannah, step on the second blue tile three times, and step on the first blue tile once to reach the warp tile. Cross the south-central room to the last warp and the Gym Leaders' room.
Twins
Tate and Liza
send out two Pokémon at once, drawing challengers into a Double Battle.
Claydol
can boost its already-high
Special Defense
with
Light Screen
, and simultaneously hit two of your Pokémon with
Earthquake
.
Xatu
's
Calm Mind
raises both its Special stats, and
Confuse Ray
allows it to harass the foe.
Lunatone
can lull its opponent to sleep with
Hypnosis
, while
Solrock
can scorch
Grass
Pokémon looking to target their
Rock
typing. Three of their Pokémon are weakened by
Water
moves; by using
Surf
, you can attack both at once and bring the battle to a quick end. Otherwise, you may want to target one Pokémon at a time in what would essentially become a two-on-one battle.

After beating the Gym, you find
Maxie
and several Grunts on their way to the Space Center. Follow them inside and defeat the four Grunts on the first floor. Upstairs, you are ambushed by three more; you fight them one at a time, but with no break between. Farther on, you find Steven confronting Maxie, who reveals his intentions for the rocket fuel. With
Groudon
gone, he has no need for their base. They're going to cause
Mt. Chimney
to erupt by dumping the entire supply into the volcano! Steven is shocked, and asks you to join him in battle against Maxie and

Having failed at both controlling Groudon and activating the volcano, Maxie begins to questions his goals and wonders if
Team Aqua
's plans are equally misguided. Maxie and his subordinates flee, and Steven invites you to his home. He greets you when you step inside, and hands you
HM08
(
Dive
). In certain bodies of water, there are dark spots where the water runs unusually deep; using Dive at one of these spots lets you descend to the ocean floor far below. Swim to a point where the sunlight filters down from above and use Dive again to surface. With this move, you will be able to pursue
Archie
to the
Seafloor Cavern
.
