Inmediately after putting an end to the battle between
Groudon
and
Kyogre
,
Rayquaza
has returned home to
Sky Pillar
. The building's advanced age coupled with the dragon's movements have left several areas of flooring
unstable
, which makes the
Mach Bike
necessary to reach the apex this time around.

A colored background means that the Pokémon can be found in this location in the specified game. A white background with a colored letter means that the Pokémon cannot be found here.
1F-5F
Enter the tower and climb the stairs to 2F. There are several patches of unstable floor here, so use the Mach Bike to speed over them and continue on. Things get tricky on 4F, where you must once again stop cycling on one of two cracked tiles on the north side of the floor; this causes you to fall back down to the previously-inaccessible part of 3F. Climb to 5F and take the stairs in the northeast to reach the apex.
Apex
Upon reaching the rooftop, you find the legendary creature fully awake beyond the final flight of stairs. At level 70,
Rayquaza
is the highest-leveled Pokémon before the credits, and as such, easily warrants the use of a
Master Ball
. If you want to save the Master Ball, you will need a similarly high-leveled Pokémon with excellent stats and several dozen
Timer Balls
. Be sure to
SAVE THE GAME
before trying to catch it! As a
Dragon
/
Flying
Pokémon, it is especially vulnerable to
Ice
attacks, but Dragon- and
Rock-type
moves are also useful. Begin with these super-effective moves to deal heavy damage, and consider putting it to sleep before it can restore its health with
Rest
. Follow up with
Grass
,
Fire
, and
Water
moves to wear its health away even further. Beware of its most dangerous move,
Outrage
: after rampaging for several turns, Rayquaza becomes confused from fatigue. While it can deal serious damage to its target, it may also cause the dragon to attack itself in its confusion, and could end up knocking itself out! If you do manage to catch it, it will prove to be useful against the
Elite Four
.

A series of ledges restrict movement from this direction, so go northeast and climb down the ladder.
B1F (front)
A short distance away, you find a fork in the road.
Taking the northwest ladder leads to the previous chamber, where another ladder leads back here. This lets you
Surf
across the water to the north doorway, which leads to a tiny chamber with
TM02
(
Dragon Claw
). It's also the only area where wild

can be found. Surf southeast from that chamber to another doorway which leads to a part of the entrance chamber that holds a

Taking the southwest ladder leads to the far northwest hill in the entrance chamber. Collect
TM23

).
Ever Grande City (south)
Ever Grande City
High above the ocean,
Ever Grande City
is lush with grass and flowers. The large waterfall makes it impossible to reach the city itself without a Pokémon able to
scale
the cascading waters. The island is divided by
Victory Road
, which runs through a large mountain at the center of the isle. Visit the Pokémon Center to make your preparations before braving this final challenge on the road to the
Pokémon League
, also in here inside is
Scott
to talk with him in his last localization before completing the game.

Head north under the first two bridges and climb the north-northwest stairway. Turn east and cross over these next two bridges to reach a

Wally
appears from the south. His defeat in your previous battle forced him to become stronger, and you find that the sickly, weak-willed kid you met back in
Petalburg City
is no more. In his place stands a confident Trainer, ready to show off how much training he's done!
VS Wally
Wally leads with his
Altaria
, a
Dragon
/
Flying
type that is especially vulnerable to
Ice
attacks. It can raise its
Attack
and
Speed
with
Dragon Dance
, so use super-effective moves to take it down before it becomes a major threat.
Delcatty
may be his weakest Pokémon, but it can still cause problems with
Sing
,
Charm
, and its
Cute Charm
Ability. Its stats aren't very threatening, but knock it out quickly to avoid these pitfalls. With moves like
Toxic
and
Leech Seed
, his
Roselia
can tip the battle in his favor as time goes on. Knock it out with
Fire
,
Ice
,
Flying
, or
Psychic
moves.
Magneton
can be a major threat due to its high
Special Attack
; strike it with
Ground
moves to take it down. Finally, Wally resorts to using his
Gardevoir
.
Psychic
and
Future Sight
are strong attacks that receive a
same-type attack bonus
, and
Calm Mind
can boost its damage output to dangerous levels. Use
Dark
,
Ghost
, and
Bug
moves to knock it out and win the battle.

Wally admits that he couldn't defeat you this time, but promises to continue his training and catch up to you one day. From this point on, he remains in Victory Road to train, and may be challenged to a rematch after entering the

. Battle Cooltrainer Hope in the northwest corner, and take the ladder down to B1F.
B1F
As this level is deeper underground, it's a good idea to use
Flash
to light the way. There are two boulders nearby; use
Strength
to move the first boulder westward and the second boulder eastward. This leads to a fork in the road. Take the northern path past cracked rocks (using
Rock Smash
), boulders, and Cooltrainer Shannon to reach the ladder in the southeast corner; this leads to a
PP Up
and a hidden
Ultra Ball
on 1F. Back on B1F, jump the nearby ledge and head north past Cooltrainer Samuel to find a
Full Restore
beyond some boulders and a cracked rock. Backtrack to the southeast ledge, then go west to reach the next ladder.
B2F
Go north to fight Cooltrainer Julie and
Surf
north across the water's edge. Climb the stairway, check the nook in the north wall for a hidden
Max Repel
, then take the northeast ladder to an isolated cliff on B1F, which holds
TM29
(
Psychic
). Back on B2F, head south to battle Cooltrainer Owen. After that, pass over the two bridges to fight Cooltrainer Caroline at the west end. Go north to find yourself at the top of a waterfall. Surf out to the northeast to battle
Cooltrainer Vito
(the last member of
Winstrate family
) and claim a
Full Heal
, then continue east to find a hidden
Elixir
atop the eastern waterfall. Turn around and ride down the western waterfall before turning east to reach the next ladder.
B1F
Fight the three nearby Cooltrainers, then head southeast and use Strength and Rock Smash to clear a way to the final ladder.
1F
Cross over the final bridge and head north to fight Cooltrainer Edgar. Go a short distance northward and turn the corner to come within view of the exit.
Ever Grande City (north)
With
Victory Road
behind you, only a long, stone walkway separates you from the Pokémon League, where the Elite Four and Champion await your challenge. Follow the walkway to the large building at its end, and prepare for your final test.
