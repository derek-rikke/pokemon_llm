Located on
Route 108
, the
Abandoned Ship
is all that remains from when the S.S. Cactus ran aground. The old vessel has many rusted holes, broken doors, and furniture scattered around. Once slated for demolition, the half-sunken vessel now exists as a refuge for water-dwelling Pokémon. Navigating the structure requires the use of
a certain field move
in addition to
Surf
, so some parts will be inaccessible for now.

Basement Key
and directs you to the facility's entrance on
Route 110
.
Surf
eastward under the north end of

Get Good with a Good Rod
The Fisherman on the river's eastern bank believes that Good Rods are really good. Agree with his statement to receive your very own

, a mid-level fishing rod that can catch even more kinds of Pokémon than the
Old Rod
.
Gabby and Ty
After your first interview on the south side of
Route 111
,
the intrepid news team
can be found searching for their next story on the eastern bank of
Route 118
's river. Accept their challenge to another
Double Battle
and be sure to give them a great interview when the dust settles!
Meet up with Steven
As you leave the beach, you are noticed by
Steven
. He hasn't seen you since your first meeting in
Granite Cave
, and is pleased to see how much you have grown as a Trainer. He wonders if you will raise Pokémon of all types, or only a certain one.
Route 123 (optional)
Before heading north to Route 119, let's head east to
Route 123
for a quick stop. The
