Pokémon League
Pokémon League Lobby
The
Pokémon League
building holds the traditional amenities. The Pokémon Center and PC are located to the left, while the Poké Mart is off to the right. It's a good idea to stock up on
Hyper Potions
,
Full Restores
, and
Full Heals
for the gauntlet ahead.
Now that you've entered the Pokémon League lobby, you can come back to it any time using
Fly
, since now the Ever Grande City has two localitations to visit when flying around Hoenn region: Pokémon Center (south) and Pokémon League (north).
To increase your chances of victory, you may want to revisit the
Lilycove Department Store
and purchase some
battle items
. These items temporarily raise one of a Pokémon's stats during battle. Using a single
X Defense
or
X Sp. Def
will boost the respective stat by 50%. Using two is equal to a 100% boost, so the Pokémon sustains half the normal amount of damage.
Dire Hits
can be useful as well, as using three or more drastically raises the odds of getting a
critical hit
. In addition, using a
Guard Spec.
protects your Pokémon from stat reduction for five turns.
With your preparations complete, talk to the two Ace Trainers guarding the doorway in the room's center. They verify that you've earned all eight
Hoenn League
Badges before stepping aside, allowing you to enter the depths of the Pokémon League. Challengers must face the
Elite Four
and
Champion
in quick succession, with no outside help. Step through the door to reach the first chamber.
Elite Four
Battle 1: Sidney
Sidney's room
The first member of the Elite Four is
Sidney
, a master
Dark-type
Trainer. His Pokémon are all vulnerable to
Bug
- and
Fighting-type
attacks, and immune to
Psychic
attacks.
He leads with his
Mightyena
, which lowers the opponent's Attack with its
Intimidate
Ability. Use Fighting-type moves, or bypass Intimidate by using special attacks or recalling a Pokémon. His
Shiftry
is a
Grass
/
Dark
type. Its only attack,
Extrasensory
, is relatively weak but can threaten Fighting-types. Other than that, its moves are all status moves, so status-healing items could be useful.
Cacturne
, like Shiftry, is another Grass/Dark Pokémon.
Leech Seed
lets it slowly sap the target's health to restore its own, and
Cotton Spore
cuts the target's
Speed
. Both Pokémon are relatively frail and pack common weaknesses, so barring status annoyance, they should fall easily. His
Crawdaunt
's low
Special Defense
means you can make quick work of it, through its
Swords Dance
can be an issue. Last up is his
Absol
; its high Attack means that any of its moves can pack a punch. Slash has an increased critical-hit ratio, while
Aerial Ace
can be used to deter Fighting Pokémon. Its defenses are mediocre, s use your strongest moves to keep up the pressure and take it down.

Battle 2: Phoebe
Phoebe's room
The second member of the Elite Four is
Phoebe
, a master
Ghost-type
Trainer. Most of her Pokémon are vulnerable to
Ghost
- and
Dark-type
moves, and immune to
Normal
and
Fighting
moves.
She leads with her first of two
Dusclops
, a defensive Ghost Pokémon that is more interested in status ailments than direct attacks.
Pressure
can waste your PP, especially when combined with
Protect
.
Confuse Ray
triggers the ever-irritating confusion, while
Curse
deals indirect damage. Phoebe has two
Banette
on her team, which can both use
Shadow Ball
. The first can burn the target with
Will-O-Wisp
and hit
Normal
Pokémon with
Faint Attack
, while the second may use
Thunderbolt
and
Psychic
for coverage. Due to its unique
Dark
/
Ghost
typing,
Sableye
has no weaknesses under normal conditions; however, its low stats make it easy to overpower with neutral attacks. Faint Attack and Shadow Ball receive a
same-type attack bonus
, and
Night Shade
deals exactly 50 damage each time it hits. Lastly, her second
Dusclops
has access to Shadow Ball,
Ice Beam
,
Rock Slide
, and
Earthquake
; despite its relatively low offenses, these allow it to deal super-effective damage against a wide variety of Pokémon. Take down her Pokémon with strong Ghost- or Dark-type attacks.

Battle 3: Glacia
Glacia's room
The third member of the Elite Four is
Glacia
, a master
Ice-type
Trainer. Her Pokémon are vulnerable to
Rock
- and
Fighting-type
attacks.
She leads with her first
Sealeo
is an
Ice
/
Water
Pokémon which tends to start things off with
Hail
. Both
Glalie
know
Ice Beam
and one or two coverage moves and are weak to
Fire
and
Steel
. Her first Glalie's
Light Screen
temporarily reduces the damage taken from Special moves, so moves like
Flamethrower
are less effective. Her second Glalie can deal serious damage with
Explosion
. Both of her nearly-identical Sealeo carry Hail in addition to damaging
Normal
and
Ice
attacks, while the second can distract male opponents with
Attract
. Use
Grass
- and
Electric-type
moves to deal super-effective damage. Glacia's biggest threat is
Walrein
, another Ice/Water Pokémon. Its high HP, Defense, and Special Defense means that not even super-effective moves will take it down easily. Decent offensive stats allow it to deal respectable damage with
Surf
,
Ice Beam
, and
Body Slam
.
Sheer Cold
instantly knocks out the target if it hits, but has low accuracy and only works on a target of a lower level than the user. Use
Fighting
or
Electric
moves to take it down quickly.

Battle 4: Drake
Drake's room
The fourth and final member of the Elite Four is
Drake
, a master
Dragon-type
Trainer. His Pokémon are all vulnerable to Dragon-type attacks, and four are weak to
Ice-type
attacks as well.
Drake leads with his
Shelgon
, a physically-oriented Pokémon.
Double-Edge
is its strongest move, while
Rock Tomb
helps the slow Pokémon even the playing field by lowering the target's
Speed
. Next up is his
Altaria
, a defensively-oriented Pokémon.
Dragon Dance
raises both its
Attack
and Speed by one stage each, which works well alongside
Double-Edge
. As a
Dragon
/
Flying
Pokémon, it takes massive damage from Ice attacks. Like Altaria, his
Kingdra
can make itself more threatening with Dragon Dance, which increases the damage it deals with
Body Slam
.
Surf
receives a
same-type attack bonus
and
SmokeScreen
lowers the target's accuracy. Due to its
Water
/
Dragon
typing, its sustains super-effective damage only from Dragon-type moves.
Flygon
enjoys high Attack and Speed, which lets it harass its foes with
Earthquake
. Though its other three moves are dependent on its lower
Special Attack
, they can still threaten Pokémon that resist Earthquake. Drake's final Pokémon is
Salamence
, a Dragon/Flying type. It has high Attack, better-than-average Speed, and respectable defenses. Its
Intimidate
Ability weakens physical attackers, so special attackers, especially those with Ice moves, will have the advantage here.

Defeating the Elite Four has earned you the right to challenge Hoenn's reigning Champion. It is important to note that you will be drawn into battle immediately upon entering the final room, so take a moment to tend to your Pokémon and save your progress before moving on.
Champion
Champion's room
Inside the Champion's hall, you find your
Wallace
waiting for you. He commends you and your Pokémon for putting an end to the crisis in
Sootopolis
. He goes on to say that Trainers raise their Pokémon by teaching them new battle techniques, but that Trainers learn just as much from their Pokémon. He challenges you to put your achievements to the test against what others like you have achieved. The stage is set for a legendary showdown! While most Champions prefer the benefits of a diverse Pokémon team, Wallace still uses his beloved
Water
Pokémon from his time as Sootopolis Gym Leader.
Wallace leads with his
Wailord
, a Water Pokémon with great
HP
but low defenses. Initially, its strongest move is
Water Spout
, which deals the most damage when its HP is full. This move receives
STAB
, and can be boosted further by rain, thus making it a potent threat. Hit it hard with
Grass
and
Electric
attacks to take it down.
Tentacruel
is designed to counter
Grass
types that might threaten its teammates with both
Sludge Bomb
and
Ice Beam
. Its
Toxic
leaves all but
Poison
and
Steel
Pokémon
badly poisoned
, where an ever-growing amount of HP is lost every turn. Ice Beam and
Hydro Pump
allow it to fight back against any
Ground
types that may try to exploit its Poison typing. As a
Water
/
Poison
Pokémon, Tentacruel is especially vulnerable to
Electric
, Ground, and
Psychic
attacks. Its
Special Defense
is nearly twice as high as its
Defense
, so prioritize physical moves over special ones.
A
Water
/
Grass
type, his
Ludicolo
can actively steal the target's health with
Giga Drain
and swamp the opposition with
Surf
.
Leech Seed
allows it to passively sap even more health from the target over several turns, and
Double Team
makes it harder to hit by boosting its evasion. Like Tentacruel, its highest stat is its
Special Defense
, so physical moves are best. Fortunately, each type from which it sustains super-effective damage—
Bug
,
Flying
, and
Poison
—are all classified as
Physical moves
.
His
Whiscash
has a fairly unique
Water
/
Ground
typing, leaving it susceptible only to
Grass
moves.
Surf
and
Earthquake
both receive
STAB
, and Earthquake allows it to counter
Electric
Pokémon which would be problematic for its teammates.
Hyper Beam
is a powerful attack but the user is forced to rest on the next turn.
Amnesia
lets it quickly bolster its
Special Defense
—its lowest stat after
Speed
. All Grass moves are classified as
Special moves
, so hammer away at its health before it can harden its defenses.
Gyarados
gets straight to business as soon as it hits the field, with its
Intimidate
Ability cutting the foe's
Attack
.
Dragon Dance
raises its
Speed
and its already-high
Attack
to sky-high levels, increasing the damage dealt by both
Hyper Beam
and
Earthquake
. Its final move,
Surf
, lets it deal reliable Water-type damage. As a
Water
/
Flying
Pokémon, it takes massive damage from
Electric
attacks, but Electric Pokémon must watch out for Earthquake. Barring that, its secondary Flying type leaves it susceptible to
Rock
moves, as well.
Finally, Wallace sends out his ace:
Milotic
, a Water Pokémon. Milotic is very bulky with its high
Special Defense
, allowing it to shrug off the
Grass
and
Electric
attacks it is weak to, and can perform stalls with
Toxic
and
Recover
.
Surf
and
Ice Beam
allow it to handle a variety of threats, including Grass Pokémon. Toxic also pressures the the target to end the match quickly. As said previously, it is weak to Grass and Electric moves, but it may be easier to target its lower physical Defense with neutrally effective physical moves.

With the battle concluded, Wallace congratulates you on your impressive victory. Just as he is about to crown you the new Hoenn League Champion, May/Brendan rushes in with some advice for challenging the Champion, only to find that you've already done so.
Professor Birch
arrives not long after, and rates your Pokédex before congratulating you as well.
Hall of Fame
Wallace then leads you into the
Hall of Fame
, where all Champions are honored. He asks that you set your Poké Balls in the machine here, so that your name and those of your Pokémon can be recorded for posterity. During the process, a shot of each fighter appears briefly on-screen. The screen fades to black, and the game is saved.
