Head west over the bridge to find two

Grunts who have just stolen a Meteorite from
Professor Cozmo
. Soon after they notice you, the leader of the opposing Team Aqua enters, flanked by two of his subordinates. The thieves don't seem to care, and flee with the Meteorite to
Mt. Chimney
. The team leader introduces himself as
Archie
, and tells you that his group intends to thwart the villainous team's plans at any cost, as they have committed many destructive acts in their bid to enlarge the landmass. The three then leave to pursue the thieves to Mt. Chimney. To pursue them yourself, exit Meteor Falls either north to
Route 114
or south to
Route 115
.
Route 115 (optional)

First, follow the eastern edge of the route until you reach a boulder that can be smashed. Pick up the Great Ball and Bluk Berries here. Battle the Pokémon Trainers, catch some more Pokémon, and continue on your way to
Mt. Chimney

Steer Clear of the Grunts
Normally, visitors to the mountaintop would be able to head south through
Jagged Pass
to reach
Lavaridge Town
. But Team Magma and Team Aqua are locked in battle all over the summit, including the entrance to the mountain pass. Let their Pokémon fight it out while you climb up north to the crater.
West of the stairway, you find Aqua Leader
Archie
in a skirmish against a group of opposing Grunts. You're only here for
Cozmo
's Meteorite, though, so slip past the battle and work your way to the northwest.
Spotted!
There are two Grunts ahead standing guard, and you are quickly drawn into battle. But you're more than a match for the pair, so finish them off quickly and continue northward.
Challenge Accepted!
Make your way farther north and you'll be stopped by
Tabitha
, who isn't about to let you pass by so easily!

With his defeat, Maxie grudgingly gives up his plans for Mt. Chimney, but reassures you that his team will still prevail. He flees along with his subordinates, a moment before Archie appears. He thanks you for your help, and pledges to continue fighting against the villainous team's destructive plans. Once he leaves, inspect the machine to retrieve the
Meteorite
for
Professor Cozmo
.
Jagged Pass (first visit)
Jagged Pass
Jagged Pass
was formed as the result of an ancient volcanic eruption. When the lava cooled, it proved to be suitable for an alternate route to the summit. Though not necessary for southward travel, the
Acro Bike

Herb Shop
At the
Herb Shop
, a woman sells
herbal medicines
for Pokémon. These natural remedies are just as effective as their traditional counterparts and less expensive, but their bitter taste make them difficult for Pokémon to take, leaving them less
friendly
toward you. As
Max Revives

Lavaridge Gym
Lavaridge Gym, 1F
Lavaridge Gym, B1F
Lavaridge Town Pokémon Gym
Leader: Flannery
One with a fiery passion that burns!
Like the name suggests, the
Lavaridge Gym
specializes in
Fire-type
Pokémon.
Grass
-,
Bug
-,
Ice
-, and
Steel-type
Pokémon are most vulnerable to their scorching attacks. While the Fire Pokémon are weak to
Water
, the prevalence of
Sunny Day
in this gym means
Ground
and
Rock
moves will give you more of an upper hand. The humid Gym features two floors; stepping on a pool of water will cause you to fall to the basement, and doing the same there will send you back to the first floor atop a geyser.
There are two nearby puddles in the first room; step on the northeast one to fall to the basement. Go southwest to battle Kindler Jace and Hiker Eli, then step on either puddle to the west to ride the geyser to the southwest part of 1F. Cooltrainer Gerald, Kindler Cole, and Kindler Axle can all be fought in this room, but to advance you need to fall through the hole to the northwest. Kindler Keegan hides in the northeast pool, while the geyser can be found by stepping on the northwest puddle. Check the northeast puddle to find Battle Girl Danielle, then drop down through the northwest hole. Go east and ride the middle geyser to 1F's north-central room. Drop through the hole in the southeast corner, jump the ledge there, and ride the final geyser up to the Gym Leader's room.
Flannery
has only recently begun serving as Gym Leader, and is intent on proving her worth. Given the chance, her Pokémon can unleash powerful moves that can reduce a challenger's party to cinders.
Sunny Day
gives a 50% power boost to all Fire attacks, which makes her Pokémon's strongest move,
Overheat
, even more devastating. Its only drawback is that it harshly lowers the user's
Special Attack
after each use, but once is usually enough! To counter this, her
Torkoal
holds a
White Herb
, which negates the first stat drop when consumed. In addition, the harsh sunlight temporarily cuts the power of Water attacks in half.
