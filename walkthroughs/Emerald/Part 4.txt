Slateport City
Slateport City
Oceanic Museum
Situated between Routes
109
and
110
,
Slateport City

Battle Tent
to the
Oceanic Museum
, there's plenty to marvel at in this seaside metropolis.

Slateport Market
The
open-air market
hosts numerous vendors peddling rare goods. A man near the southern entrance hints that you'll find even more bargains after obtaining
TM43
(
Secret Power
). Permanent stat-boosting
Vitamins
can be purchased from the Energy Guru. The red-clad clerk standing next to him will give your lead Pokémon an
Effort Ribbon
if it has been well-trained. Also after obtaining TM43, another clerk appears from whom additional copies of that and
TM10
(
Hidden Power
) may be purchased.
In the northeast stall, a woman hands out a
Powder Jar
to each visitor. This jar is used to store
Berry Powder
obtained by playing the
Berry Crush
minigame in a Pokémon Center's Union Room. Collect enough powder and you can trade it to her in exchange for vitamins and
herbal medicine
.
Pokémon Fan Club
The
Pokémon Fan Club
can be found just north of the Market. If your lead Pokémon is
friendly
enough toward you, you can receive a
Soothe Bell
from the woman near the back wall. Visit with the club's chairman to have him examine your lead Pokémon's condition. If any of its five Contest stats are high enough, he will reward you with a special item—a
Red
,
Blue
,
Pink
,
Green
, or
Yellow Scarf
. When held, these items boost their respective stat during the Appeal Round of a Pokémon Contest.
Move Tutor
Also inside is a man and his
Azumarill
; this
Move Tutor
offers to teach the move
Swagger
to a Pokémon, one time only.
Name Rater
North of the Fan Club building is the home of the
Name Rater
. This man has the power to evaluate and change your Pokémon's nicknames as often as you'd like. However, he cannot change a Pokémon's nickname if it first belonged to someone else.
Battle Tent
The
Slateport Battle Tent
stands in the northwest corner of the city. If you enter to the Battle Tent after getting the Devon Goods in Oceanic Museum, then
Scott
will come out of the Battle Tent if you try to go in and urge you to take the challenge. At this location, entrants must select three Pokémon from a random list of six
rental Pokémon
, all at level 30. They must then face three opposing Trainers, and after defeating each one, challengers may trade one of their Pokémon for one belonging to their opponent. No details on the opponent's Pokémon are given; challengers must instead rely on their experience battling the opponent's team. The reward for winning three consecutive battles here is a
Full Heal
. No experience or prize money is awarded.
Slateport Harbor
The Harbor is located in the city's northeast district. Since construction is not yet complete on the new ferry, there is little to do here at the moment.
Stern's Shipyard
Inside
Stern's Shipyard
, you find
the captain
's assistant,
Dock
, looking over plans for the
new ferry
that is under construction here. Though Stern is nowhere to be found, Dock asks that you deliver the
Devon Goods
to him.
Oceanic Museum
At first, it is impossible to enter the
Oceanic Museum
because of the
Team Aqua
Grunts lined up outside. But by the time you visit the shipyard, the group has made its way into the building. Pay the
$
50 entrance fee to follow them inside. Those that can't afford it will be mistaken as part of "the group that came in earlier", and allowed in for free. The Grunts are more interested in the exhibits than you, so you can speak to them in an effort to gauge their intentions. A Grunt near the entrance is shocked to see you; it's the same guy you fought back in
Rusturf Tunnel
! He's learned not to mess with you, and begs forgiveness with
TM46
(
Thief
) before fleeing the scene. Go upstairs to find
Captain Stern
, examining a display in the lower-right corner. Before you can hand over the
Devon Goods
for his new ferry, you are attacked by two Grunts! Defeat one after the other to save the captain and complete the delivery for
Mr. Stone
.

by their names, when alerted for a rematch using the item, may use higher-level Pokémon.
Shocked at their failure, the two begin to plan their next move when a stranger appears. It's their boss,
Aqua Leader
Archie
! He wonders aloud why you would even want to hinder their plans, but forgives you as he thinks you're too young to understand their ideals. As the group departs, he warns you against interfering with their future plans. When you step outside, you are approached again by Scott. He seems to be a talent scout of some sort, and takes the opportunity to register himself in your PokéNav before heading off. Its advisable to buy a piece of
Harbor Mail
for
$
50 before leaving the city, since you'll need to trade it to girl in
Mauville City
to get a new item.
Route 110
Route 110
The lengthy
Route 110
connects two of
Hoenn
's largest cities,
Slateport
and
Mauville
, and also links back to
Route 103
. All pedestrians are restricted to the lower path, which features the mysterious
Trick House
. After obtaining a Bike, you can speed through the route on
Seaside Cycling Road
.

Trick House
The
Trick House
is located farther north, near the
Route 103
junction. The building's owner, the
Trick Master
, is a fun-loving prankster who has crafted many entertaining tricks for travelers. A new challenge opens each time you earn a

Finding the Trick Master
When you step inside, you can't shake the feeling that someone is watching you. The mischievous Trick Master is hiding somewhere! Search the entire room until you find him, when he accepts your challenge and disappears. Certain field moves are required for most of the mazes, so you will need to return later to complete the rest.
Inside the Maze
Once he leaves, examine the scroll on the wall to find a secret passage that leads to a devious maze. Navigate the maze and battle Trainers as you search for a rolled-up scroll with a secret code. Reach the back of the maze and examine the hanging scroll. Inscribe the code on the hidden door to open it. There's no going back, so be sure to find everything the maze has to offer before entering the next room!
Trick Master's Room
The Trick Master waits here for all challengers. Speak to him to receive your reward, then leave through the exit in the north wall. After the last challenge, you can find a hidden
Nugget
where the Trick Master had stood.
Rival Battle 3
Go east from the Trick House and pass beneath Cycling Road. Turn north and continue on until you meet
May
/
Brendan
again. It seems like ages since you last met, so prove to your friend how far you've come as a Trainer! May and Brendan use the same three Pokémon, but May leads with

After the battle, May/Brendan hands you the

Mauville City
.
Route 103 (optional)
Go to the left of the Trick House. Back to
Route 103
!. This is the eastern side of the route. It won't take you back to
Oldale Town
before you earn more
Badges
, but there are a lot of Trainers here. It's a good idea to battle them all— it's excellent training for your upcoming Gym battle.
