Devon Corporation, from Mr. Stone in his office
E
Devon Corporation
Now that you have reclaimed the
Devon Goods
, head back to the Devon Corporation building in
Rustboro
's northwest corner. The grateful Devon researcher is waiting on the city's east side, and hands you a
Great Ball
before escorting you inside to meet his boss.
On the third floor, the company president introduces himself as
Mr. Stone
. He thanks you for reclaiming the stolen parts, then asks for another favor. He doesn't expect you to work for free, of course, and rewards you with your very own
PokéNav
! In return, he asks that you deliver a
Letter
to a man named
Steven
in
Dewford Town
. To reach Dewford, you will need to cross the sea, so Mr. Stone suggests booking passage with
Mr. Briney
, the friendly old sailor from
Route 104
.
As you leave, take note of the Scientists on the second floor. None of them are having much luck with their projects, except one, who has developed a device that can resurrect ancient Pokémon from
Fossils
.
PokéNav
The
PokéNav
is a small, electronic device produced by Devon Corporation under the orders of Mr. Stone, who wanted a way to keep track of a Pokémon's feelings. It has four different functions, though only Map and Condition are available at first.
The Map page displays a map of
Hoenn
, along with the user's current location. It's also possible to zoom in to see a basic layout of towns and cities.
The Condition page shows a Pokémon's five Contest stats in detail. It can be used to search for party Pokémon, or all owned Pokémon at once.
The Match Call function records data of up to 85 people, including non-Trainers like
Mom
and
Professor Birch
, and allows the user to call anyone who has registered their PokéNav with the user. This will also alert the user when any registered Trainer, including Gym Leaders, want a rematch. Only the first four rematches with each Trainer will see their Pokémon rise in level and evolve, though there is no limit on the number of times these Trainers may be rebattled. After entering the
Hall of Fame
, each Gym Leader will offer a rematch as a
Double Battle
.
There are several people whom you have already encountered, that you must seek out and speak with in order to register them:
Littleroot Town
: Mom, Professor Birch
Route 102
: Youngster Calvin
Route 104
(south): Lady Cindy
Petalburg Woods
: Bug Catcher James
Route 104 (north): Rich Boy Winston, Lass Haley
Route 116
: School Kid Karen, School Kid Jerry
Rustboro Gym
: Roxanne (she will do so at some point after you defeat
Brawly
, the next Gym)
The Ribbons page displays all Ribbons the user's Pokémon have acquired. Though hidden initially, this function unlocks when any of the user's Pokémon gains a Ribbon.
When you leave the building, you are stopped by one of the Devon Scientists. He adds the Match Call function to your new PokéNav, and asks that you call Mr. Stone as a tutorial.
Rival Battle 2 (optional)
May/Brendan is waiting for you just outside the Poké Mart. She/He notices the Match Call feature on your new PokéNav, and each Trainer registers the other. Your friend mentions passing
Mr. Briney
in
Petalburg Woods
, before asking about your Pokédex and challenging you to a battle.

Routes 105 and 106
Route 105
As the voyage is a quick one, there is no time to fully explore the waters of Routes
105
and
106
just yet. Return after earning the
fifth Badge
in order to
travel
at your own speed.
Checking In
As you sail with
Mr. Briney
through Route 105, you receive a call on your PokéNav. It's
Dad
; he heard from
Mr. Stone
about you getting the device and just wanted to check in. After the brief conversation, the ship makes landfall in Dewford Town.
Dewford Town
Dewford Town
Dewford Town
is a tiny island town in the southern ocean. Despite its isolation, many Trainers visit the area to challenge the
Dewford Gym
.

Dewford Hall
Located to the north of the Pokémon Center, Dewford Hall is known as "Everyone's Information Exchange". Though Dewford is a tiny island community, when someone coins a
trendy phrase
here, it quickly spreads throughout the region. Speak to the boy outside the building to learn the coolest thing in cool right now; if you disagree, he offers a chance to change the current phrase, which the residents inside will quickly adopt.
Hook the Big One!
Speak to the Fisherman outside the Gym, and answer his question to receive the
Old Rod
. This low-end fishing rod can hook Pokémon from almost any body of water, so be sure to try it out everywhere!
Dewford Gym
Dewford Gym
Dewford Town Pokémon Gym
Leader: Brawly
A big wave in fighting!
The
Dewford Gym
specializes in
Fighting-type
Pokémon.
Flying
- and
Psychic-type
moves are the most useful here, so this is a great opportunity to train a
Taillow
,
Wingull
, or
Ralts
. Keep your
Normal
-,
Rock
-,
Steel
-, and
Dark-type
Pokémon out of the fray for now. The Gym is dimly lit when you first enter, but the building lights up bit by bit for each Gym Trainer you defeat. Once the Gym Leader is defeated, the entire Gym lights up completely.
Even with only three Pokémon,
Brawly
can be a tough opponent. Both his
Machop
and
Makuhita
have the
Guts
Ability, which boosts the Pokémon's
Attack
by 50% when afflicted by a non-volatile status condition.
Meditite
can use
Reflect
and
Light Screen
to boost his team's
Defense
and
Special Defense
, respectively, and its
Focus Punch
is dangerous if you ever let Meditite go an entire turn without taking a hit.
Bulk Up
allows all three to raise their Attack and
Defense
.
