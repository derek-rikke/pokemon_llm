Route 119
Route 119
Known for its sweltering heat and
rainfalls
, the spacious
Route 119
runs north from
Route 118
to
Fortree City
. The extreme weather conditions make this an ideal setting for the
Weather Institute
, located on the north end of this tropical rainforest. You'll need the
Acro Bike
to pick up all the items here.
The area is filled with patches of
long grass
, which prevent using both bikes and hide Trainers and wild Pokémon. One of these wild Pokémon is
Tropius
, which can learn
Fly
along with four other
HM
moves. It will be very useful if you cannot or do not want to teach those HM moves to the Pokémon that you use in battle.

The Mimic Circle
A handful of Trainers in the southernmost patch of long grass like to copy the movements of any Trainer passing by, collectively earning them the "Mimic Circle" nickname. They move when you do, so outmaneuver them to pin them down and start battling. Each one remains in a certain area, which gives you a chance to corner them.
Finding Feebas
Feebas
can only be found by fishing in one of six water tiles along the route. Adding to the difficulty, other Pokémon besides Feebas can also appear in the Feebas tiles as well. There is no known easy method to determine which tiles contain Feebas: the only way is to fish repeatedly in each and every water tile on the route, doing so enough times to be reasonably confident that no Feebas are in that tile (or else risk missing a tile). (If the player reels in one Pokémon in every tile, there is a 1 in 64 (approximately 1.6%) chance that the player will pass over all six Feebas tiles without reeling in a single Feebas.) Any rod can find Feebas, and Feebas can be fished from the same tile many times. The tiles' locations are independent of the
trend
in
Dewford Town
, although the tiles' location will change every time the trend does.
Weather Institute
Located on the north end of the route, the
Weather Institute
is a high-tech facility used to study and research the intricacies of weather patterns across
Hoenn
. This research seems to have attracted the attention of
Team Aqua
, as several Grunts have been stationed outside.

Rest and Restore Health
Visit the back room to find some Team Aqua Grunts searching the place. Before battling them, head to the northwest room to find a comfy bed and rest your Pokémon before continuing on. There is also a PC here in case you should need to reorganize your team.
Looking for Answers
When you reach the second floor, you find the source of the disturbance: Aqua Admin
Shelly
is harassing the researchers! She is here looking for information about extreme weather conditions, and to steal one of the Institute's
Castform
, a rare species of Pokémon. She can't allow you to meddle in the team's plans, and draws you into battle.

The Next Step
The Admin simply shrugs off her defeat, claiming that the team has other plans before she and the Grunts leave the building. As thanks for your help, one of the researchers even rewards you with a new Pokémon,
Castform
, which changes its type and appearance based on the current weather.
Rival Battle 4
Leave the building and cross the upper bridge.

Once you defeat her/him, your friend rewards you with
HM02
(
Fly
). It's a strong move in battle and even more useful when used in the field, though you'll need to win the Gym Badge from the next city first. She/He then runs off, leaving you to continue on to
Fortree City
.
Just as your neighbor climbs the hill to Fortree,
Scott
is headed south away from it. He congratulates you on winning your latest match, and expects great things from you at the
Fortree Gym
.
Fortree City
Fortree City
Fortree City
is located in an old-growth forest with many towering trees. These ancient arbors are so large that the residents were able to build cozy homes among their branches. A shop offering Secret Base decorations can be found in the southeast part of town, and the
Fortree Gym
can be found in the heart of the city. Unfortunately, the Gym's entrance is obstructed by something invisible.

The north-northwest house belongs to an old woman. Speak to her to take a quiz. She holds a coin in her hand, and asks in which one you think it's hidden. Guess correctly
three times in a row
to receive
TM10
(

)! This unique attack is listed as a
Normal-type
move, but its type and power vary depending on the Pokémon using it.
Speak to the woman's elderly husband to learn that he talks in his sleep. He offers to teach the move
Sleep Talk
to a Pokémon, one time only.

The little boy in the northwest house wants a

. If you happened to catch one back on
