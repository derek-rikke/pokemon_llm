Scott

Route 117
. Soon after that, you receive a call from
Wally
. His uncle has just bought him a PokéNav, and he's excited that he can contact you anytime.
Mauville Gym
Mauville Gym
Mauville City Pokémon Gym
Leader: Wattson
The cheerfully electrifying man!
The
Mauville Gym
specializes in
Electric-type
Pokémon. While most Pokémon of this type are only vulnerable to
Ground-type
attacks, the other Pokémon inside make
Fire
and
Fighting
moves useful as well. Keep your
Water
- and
Flying-type
Pokémon on the sidelines for now. The Gym features several electrical barriers, which can be turned on and off by stepping on thunderbolt-shaped switches. To reach the Gym Leader, simply step on the southwest switch.
Wattson
leads with his
Voltorb
. Though its
Attack
is low, its
Selfdestruct
may unexpectedly knock out one of your Pokémon. His
Electrike
is not much of a threat, but it can strike first with
Quick Attack
. Pokémon that use
contact
moves against Electrike also risk becoming paralyzed due to its
Static
Ability.
Magneton
likes to start with
Supersonic
to confuse its foe. Its
Special Attack
is dangerously high, which allows it to deal serious damage with the unavoidable
Shock Wave
move; fortunately, it also sustains quadruple damage from Ground moves. His
Manectric
can use
Howl
to raise its
Attack
, which boosts the damage dealt by Quick Attack. It can also actively paralyze the foe with
Thunder Wave
, and like Electrike, has the Static Ability.

Pokémon Day Care
The

is a facility that raises Pokémon for busy Trainers. For a small fee, up to two Pokémon can be left here to be raised by the Day Care staff. During their stay, Pokémon will gradually level up and learn new moves. When two
compatible
Pokémon are left at the same time, you may return to find an
Egg
! Speak to the Day-Care Man and he will hint at the odds of finding one.

Whenever an Egg is found, the Day-Care Man will be standing farther away from the fence, eager to talk to you. Speak to him to receive the Egg, and carry it with you on your journey. The more you travel with an Egg, the faster the Pokémon inside will hatch.
Verdanturf Town (optional)
Verdanturf Town
Verdanturf
is a small town just west of

Another

Battle Tent
The
Verdanturf Battle Tent
stands in the northwest corner of town, and is the second of three scattered throughout
Hoenn
. At this location, challengers select three of their Pokémon to battle three opposing Trainers. These Trainers' Pokémon will either be level 30, or match the highest-leveled Pokémon in your party, whichever is higher. Trainers take a backseat here, while their Pokémon battle on their own, using moves most suited to their
Natures
. All moves are grouped into three categories; Attack, Defense, and Support. Each Nature has a ratio of Attack, Defense, and Support moves that Pokémon with that Nature will prefer to use, but these ratios may change when a Pokémon's HP falls below 50%. During battle, a Pokémon chooses one of these categories, then selects a random attack from its moveset that matches that category. If no such attack exists, the Pokémon will "appear incapable of using its power" and skip its turn. The reward for winning three consecutive battles here is a
Nest Ball
.
Scott
can be found in the entry hall, in which he only appear in this place if you have the
Dynamo Badge
, a requirement we fulfill. He claims that a Battle Tent is a great place to meet tough Trainers, and expects you to do your best here.
Wanda's House
The middle home on the south side belongs to
Wanda
, who happens to be
Wally

Rusturf Tunnel
. She often goes there to visit him.
