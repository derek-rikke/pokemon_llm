Sootopolis City
Sootopolis City
rises from the crater of an inactive volcano and can only be reached by sea or sky. The
final Gym
in the
Hoenn League
is located here, but there are more urgent matters to attend to first. With
Hoenn
's weather becoming increasingly oppressive, you must race to the
Cave of Origin
and stop the super-ancient Pokémon from destroying the entire region! A girl named
Kiri
lives here and will give you two Berries each day, but she will not give out Berries while
Groudon
and
Kyogre
battle. If you visit Sootopolis City before completing
Seafloor Cavern
, you can collect all items here early (except
HM07
(
Waterfall
)). The Gym will still be closed.

A colored background means that the Pokémon can be found in this location in the specified game. A white background with a colored letter means that the Pokémon cannot be found here.
Note: No surfing Pokémon can appear during the battle between Groudon and Kyogre.
A Battle of Legends
When you surface inside the crater, you find
Groudon
and
Kyogre
locked in battle a short distance ahead. The unending shifts in weather have frightened many of the city's residents into their homes with their doors locked tight, while others brave the elements to witness the super-ancient Pokémon fighting.
Maxie
and
Archie
stand outside the Gym, which is also closed, begging the two Pokémon to stop their battle, but to no effect.
Catch Up with Steven
Surf westward from the Gym to a grassy shore to meet
Steven
. He assumes that your presence here means that you're prepared to become involved in this crisis, and has someone he would like you to meet. He leads you around to the north side of the crater and the entrance to the
Cave of Origin
. After a word with the guard, he asks you to search the cave for someone named
Wallace
.

The

There's not a moment to lose! Sprint down the entry hall to reach the cave's interior.
1F
Head in a clockwise direction to reach the ladder in the northeast.
B1F
The lowest floor is lined with sapphires and rubies. Visit the south side of this mist-filled room to meet
Wallace
. He was once the
Sootopolis Gym
Leader, but something came up that caused him to leave the Gym in the care of his mentor,
Juan
. According to Wallace,
Groudon
and
Kyogre
are not the only super-ancient Pokémon—there is a third somewhere, named
Rayquaza
. It's believed that it was Rayquaza that becalmed the two combatants in the distant past, but even Wallace can't be sure where it's located now. He asks if you might know where it is, and after you mention
Sky Pillar
, he sets off in search of the ancient creature. To follow him, you'll need to trek through the southeast ocean beginning with
Route 129
.
Note: the entrance to the Cave of Origin is blocked for the rest of the game after awakening Rayquaza.
Route 129
Route 129
Route 129
lies to the south of

Mirage Island
While
Route 130
usually appears as a simple stretch of ocean, it is sometimes home to a strange island that seems to appear and disappear. This rare island is inhabited only by
Wynaut
, which range in level from 5 to 50. A soft soil patch on the island's east side holds a single
Liechi Berry
tree. This is the best Berry to use in
Pokéblocks
, as it will produce Gold Pokéblocks.
Route 131
Route 131
Route 131
lies between

Sky Pillar
.

. Speak with him every day to learn if the island has appeared.
Move Tutor
Visit the Pokémon Center and speak to the young man near the entrance. He offers to teach the move
