Deep inside the woods, you come across a researcher from

Rustboro City
. After explaining that he is looking for a
Shroomish
, he is suddenly confronted by a member of
Team Aqua
. The thug had planned to ambush the worker when he left the woods, but grew too impatient for that. Defeat him in battle and he flees the scene, but not before hinting that his friends are up to something in Rustboro. The grateful researcher gives you a
Great Ball
as thanks. He then heals your Pokémon, and rushes off to Rustboro after realizing what his attacker wanted.

Devon Corporation
Devon Corporation
is headquartered in a large stone building in the northwest part of town. The company is responsible for manufacturing many of the items Trainers rely on every day, including several variations of Poké Ball and medicine. Only authorized personnel are allowed past the first floor.

stands to the northeast of the Pokémon Center. Talk with the teacher to receive a

The Man in Sunglasses
Just inside the entrance, you find the Man in Sunglasses again, who introduces himself as
Scott
. He's been searching everywhere for outstanding Trainers, specifically Pokémon battle experts. He wonders what brings you here to school, and claims that the first thing you should do as a new Trainer is teach
Cut
to one of your Pokémon. It's a useful field move, but using it outside of battle requires the badge from the local Gym.
It is advisable to talk to Scott every time you see him at each location that appears throughout the game as you will get a
reward
later.
Time for a Trade
The Rustboro Gym beckons, but before you step inside, visit the house to the east. Inside is a boy who is looking to trade his
Seedot
for a
Ralts
. Seedot is a Grass Pokémon that eventually evolves into a
Grass
/
Dark
Pokémon,
Shiftry
. This one is even holding a
Chesto Berry
to sweeten the deal.

-loving honor student!
The

specializes in
Rock-type
Pokémon. Use
Grass
,
Water
, and
Fighting
moves, such as
Water Gun
and
Bullet Seed
, to deal serious damage, and avoid battling with
Fire
-,
Bug
-, or
Flying-type
Pokémon. As hers is the first Gym in the
Hoenn League
, this graduate of the
Pokémon Trainer's School
has opted for a layout that gives novice Trainers a chance to avoid her subordinates and challenge the Gym Leader directly. Use
Defense
-lowering moves like
Leer
to soften up Roxanne's rock-solid Pokémon, and moves like
Growl
to weaken their
Attack
. As
Rock
/
Ground
Pokémon, her two
Geodude
are especially vulnerable to Grass and Water moves, sustaining 4× the normal amount of damage.

Rusturf Tunnel
Rusturf Tunnel
Rusturf Tunnel
was a construction project by
Devon Corporation
that aimed to link
Rustboro City
and western
Hoenn
to the rest of the region. The tunnel was nearly complete when Devon's president,
Mr. Stone
, realized that the work was disturbing the local
Whismur
population. The project was canceled, though only a small bit of debris,
easily cleared
, remained to hinder travel.
