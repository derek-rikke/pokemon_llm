Introduction
After the title screen, the resident researcher of the
Hoenn
region,
Professor Birch
, appears and introduces new Trainers to the Pokémon world. The professor continues, asking the player to select both a gender and a name, which can be up to seven characters long. With that done, Birch sends the player off to begin their journey!
Home
The game begins
in the back of a moving truck
, as your family has just moved here from the far-off
Johto
region. Hop out of the truck to meet
Mom
and step inside your new home. Head upstairs to check out your room and set the clock. Return to the first floor and Mom excitedly calls you over to the TV; the current program just aired a segment about the
Petalburg Gym
, where your dad is the new
Gym Leader
. She then suggests visiting his friend, your new neighbor, Professor Birch. Welcome to Littleroot Town!
Littleroot Town
Littleroot Town
Littleroot
is a quaint little town nestled on the lush southern edge of the
Hoenn
mainland. There are only three buildings here; your home,
Professor Birch
's home, and the professor's Pokémon Laboratory, where he conducts research on Pokémon distribution, in the south.

Professor Birch's House
Having just moved to a new town, why not meet your new neighbors? Visit the house next door to meet the professor's wife, then head upstairs to meet his child. The room is empty at first, but inspect the item on the floor and
May
/
Brendan
enters. Your new friend introduces herself/himself but suddenly leaves, remembering that Birch asked for help in catching a Pokémon.
Route 101
Route 101
Choose wisely!
Route 101
is a short path that connects
Littleroot Town
to
Oldale Town
in the north. The route features several patches of
tall grass
, a favorite hiding place of wild Pokémon.
Save the Professor!
When you first reach the area, you find
Professor Birch
being chased around by a wild
Zigzagoon
! His Bag has fallen out of his reach, and he pleads with you for help. Choose one of the three Pokémon from the Poké Balls inside the professor's Bag, and use it to scare off his attacker.

The
Grass-type
Treecko
has the most weaknesses of the trio, with five:
Fire
-,
Bug
-,
Poison
-,
Flying
-, and
Ice-type
attacks. It and its evolutions excel in
Special Attack
and
Speed
. Its Grass moves are strong against
Water
-,
Rock
-, and
Ground-type
Pokémon, though they have relatively low base powers.
The
Fire-type
Torchic
is great when battling
Grass
-,
Bug
-,
Ice
-, and
Steel-type
Pokémon, but is vulnerable to
Water
- and
Ground-type
moves. It and its evolved forms focus on
Attack
and
Special Attack
. As it grows, it gains a secondary
Fighting-type
type, making it better against
Normal
, Rock, and
Dark
-types.
The
Water-type
Mudkip
has an advantage when facing
Fire
-,
Rock
-, and
Ground-type
Pokémon, but may struggle against
Grass
and
Electric
attacks. It and its evolutions specialize in
Attack
. As it grows, it gains a secondary Ground type, which protects it from Electric attacks and also gives an advantage over Poison and Steel-types. Grass attacks, its one remaining weakness, is uncommon in Emerald. Mudkip is notably able to learn
Surf
when other Pokémon are still relying on much weaker attacks.
Littleroot Town
Birch's Lab
After scaring off the wild Pokémon, Birch invites you back to the Lab. As thanks for rescuing him, he happily lets you keep the young Pokémon. He then encourages you to visit May/Brendan on
Route 103
for tips on how to be a Pokémon Trainer. When your Pokémon needs a rest, head back home and visit with Mom to have her restore it to full health.
Route 101
Route 103, need to take Route 101 to Oldale Town. With ledges blocking the way, you must go through the
tall grass
to keep moving north. Pokémon can be battled, but not captured, seeing as you don't have any
Poké Balls
yet.

Oldale Town
Oldale Town
Oldale Town
is the first settlement in the region to feature a
Pokémon Center
and a
Poké Mart
. Pokémon Centers are essentially hospitals where creatures can be restored to perfect health. The PC on the counter is always available for Trainers to organize their Pokémon. Poké Marts offer a wide range of items for sale, from Potions to Poké Balls.

There is a patch of

trees can be found growing here. Collect the fruit and the trees disappear, allowing you to plant another Berry to continue the cycle. The amount of time needed for the new tree to fully mature and produce fruit varies based on the kind of Berry. After obtaining a
watering can
, you may water the young plants at certain times to increase the Berry yield. Berries can have several useful effects, from curing status conditions to restoring health. They can even be turned into

Petalburg City (first visit)
Petalburg City
Situated between
Route 102
to the east and
Route 104
to the west,
Petalburg City
is the first location you reach to feature a
Pokémon Gym
.
Meet up with Dad
When you visit the
Petalburg Gym
, you find your father,
Norman
, standing in the lobby. He is surprised that you've made it this far from home but is excited that you are becoming a Pokémon Trainer like him. A sickly boy named
Wally
soon enters, and explains that he will be staying with relatives in nearby
Verdanturf Town
in the hopes that the clean air will do him good. He is afraid of becoming lonely there and asks for help in catching a Pokémon to take along. Norman asks that you go with him and loans him his
Zigzagoon
and a
Poké Ball
. Wally leads you back to
Route 102
, where he successfully catches a
Ralts
.
Back at the Gym, Wally can't thank you enough for helping him catch his very own Pokémon. Your father then gives you some advice: to become a strong Trainer, challenge Gym Leader
Roxanne
in
Rustboro City
before moving on to the other Gym Leaders. Though Norman is also a Gym Leader, he will not accept your challenge until you have earned four
Badges
.
The Man in Sunglasses
As you reach the city's western limit, you are stopped by a man in sunglasses. Judging by the way you are dressed, he assumes that you're a Pokémon Trainer. However, he reconsiders after seeing your not-so-dirty clothes, determining you to be either a rookie Trainer or just an ordinary kid. He informs you that he is roaming the land in search of powerful Trainers, and apologizes for taking your time before leaving for
Route 104
.
