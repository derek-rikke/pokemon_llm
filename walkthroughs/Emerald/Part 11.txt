Gabby and Ty
After defeating
Gabby and Ty
on
Route 118
, the news team can now be found in the northeast corner of the route. Accept their challenge and give them another great interview afterwards!
The Unseen Objects
You meet Steven again on the northern bridge. It seems that another unseen object blocks the way forward, but luckily, he has a way to solve this mystery. He puts on the
Devon Scope
, a high-tech piece of eyewear that reveals invisible objects. Sure enough, it reveals a
Kecleon
in front of you; catch or defeat the Pokémon to clear the bridge. Pleased with your actions, Steven allows you to keep the device. With the Devon Scope in hand, you can chase off the Kecleon outside the Gym. Head back into town to win your next Badge, or continue exploring the route.
In the route 119 there are 2 invisible Kecleon, while in the route 120 there are 6 invisible Kecleon.
Scorched Slab
Scorched Slab
is a cave jutting up out of the north lake. The entrance lies at water level, so the single chamber inside holds mostly water. At the far end of the cave, a small slab of rock holds a single bit of treasure,

Sunny Day
).

After defeating the Fortree Gym
TM40
(
Aerial Ace
)
From Winona upon her defeat
E
Fortree Gym
Fortree Gym
Fortree City Pokémon Gym
Leader: Winona
The bird user taking flight into the world.
The
Fortree Gym
specializes in
Flying-type
Pokémon, which take serious damage from
Electric
,
Rock
, and
Ice
moves. The Gym is fairly straightforward, with a single path leading up to the Gym Leader's lofty perch. The only obstacles are turnstiles, some of which can only be spun in certain directions. Pass through the first two turnstiles to reach Bird Keeper Humberto. After that, spin the third turnstile clockwise to reach Picnicker Ashley and Bird Keeper Jared. Spin the fourth turnstile clockwise, then do the same for the fifth. Go back to the fourth and push the larger side southward, then spin it clockwise again. Pass through the fifth turnstile again to reach Camper Flint and Bird Keeper Edwardo on the other side. Defeat Bird Keeper Darius to the west, then there are only three turnstiles left. Spin the smallest one counter-clockwise without walking through it, then pass through all three in a counter-clockwise circle. Push the larger side of the southeast one eastward, then go northeast to reach the Gym Leader.
Winona
starts off with
Swablu
; not very threatening on its own, but
Mirror Move
executes the previous move used by the target, and
Perish Song
causes any Pokémon on the field to faint in three turns. Her
Tropius
relies on the sun;
Sunny Day
both doubles its
Speed
due to its
Chlorophyll
Ability, eliminates the charging turn needed for
SolarBeam
while active. It also makes
Synthesis
more effective, restoring 66% of its HP rather than the usual 50%. Her
Pelipper
takes massive damage from
Electric
attacks.
Rock
moves are also effective, but Rock Pokémon should be wary of its
Water Gun
.
Skarmory
has several resistances and a high physical
Defense
, which may rise even higher due to
Steel Wing
.
Sand-Attack
makes it harder to hit, while
Aerial Ace
's perfect
accuracy
lets it reliably land a hit. Due to its
Dragon
typing, her
Altaria
takes only normal damage from Electric moves. Rock moves will be more effective, and Ice moves are greater still. It can target unsuspecting Electric types with
Earthquake
, and can raise its
Attack
and
Speed
with
Dragon Dance
.

Upon her defeat,
Winona
awards you the
Feather Badge
, which ensures obedience from all Pokémon up to level 70 and enables the use of
Fly
in the field. This move allows you to instantly revisit any city or town you've previously explored. She also hands out
TM40
(
Aerial Ace
) as a prize, and registers herself in your PokéNav.
A short time after you leave the Gym, you receive a call from
Scott
. He's impressed that you defeated the Fortree Gym, and wonders if you could be the Trainer he's been searching for. He also reminds you that he'll keep cheering for you from the sidelines.
