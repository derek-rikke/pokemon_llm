Interior
On 1F, talk to the old woman in the northeast corner. Concerned for your safety, she gives you a
Cleanse Tag
, which reduces the wild encounter rate when held by your lead Pokémon.
On 6F, pick up
TM30
(
Shadow Ball
) from the south side before falling through the nearby hole in the floor. On the south side of 5F, you find a
Lax Incense
, which boosts the holder's
evasiveness
by 5%. Fall through the southeast hole to return to 4F, where you find a
Sea Incense
. This item gives
Water
moves a 20% power boost when held. These Incenses also allow
Wobbuffet
,
Marill
, and
Azumarill
to produce
Wynaut
and
Azurill
Eggs at the Day Care.
Exterior
Reaching the summit means a long climb up the mountainside. Be sure to collect
TM48
(
Skill Swap
) and the
Max Potion
before moving on.
Summit
When you reach the summit, you are finally able to catch up to
Team Aqua
. Show no mercy to the four Grunts lining the path as you advance northward. Upon reaching the mountain's highest peak,
Archie
informs you that
Maxie
and
Team Magma
beat them to the summit, but he also got what he wanted, and steals the
Red Orb
from its altar! Like your last meeting atop
Mt. Chimney
, he doesn't have much time to waste on you. He orders his team to fall back, and the group disappears in an instant. Afterward, the elderly woman caretaker tells you that the two Orbs belong together and must never be separated as they are now. She says that although Team Magma showed up first and was able to steal the
Blue Orb
, they left something behind in their haste. She gives you the
Magma Emblem
, in the hopes that it may be useful.

Having received the

from the caretakers atop
Mt. Pyre
, the next step is to use it.
Fly
back to
Lavaridge Town
and
Route 112
, then either enter
Jagged Pass
from the south and use the
Acro Bike
to scale the cliffs, or ride the cable car to the summit and descend. Hike through the area until you reach the halfway point, where you passed that Magma Grunt on your first visit. Just then, a suspicious-looking part of the cliffside begins shaking in response to the Magma Emblem. By the time the tremor subsides, a gaping hole has appeared in the rock!

Collect a
Max Revive
from the northwest corner, then turn south. Up ahead, you find Maxie standing on the edge of a lava pool, talking to the sleeping form of the super-ancient Pokémon,
