The waters of Routes
132
,

, and

hold strong ocean currents that make travel difficult. While moving primarily westbound, these currents can send you sailing in almost any direction. This makes it necessary to revisit the area in order to explore every island.

Northern path
Ride the central currents to Swimmer Gilbert, then sail westward to reach a
Rare Candy
opposite Black Belt Kiyo on the northwest island. From here, Surf westward through the northern shallows of Route 133 to reach the north side of the route's northwest island. Collect the
Star Piece
here, then sail west to the calm waters on Route 134's north side. Take the current south of here to reach the large, thin island. Fight Black Belt Hitoshi and Battle Girl Reyna, collect the nearby
Carbos
, then Surf west to reach the shallows outside
Slateport City
.
Central path
Ride the southern currents to the southeast island to fight Fisherman Ronald. Wade into the waters off the north end of the shallows to follow the current to Black Belt Kiyo on the northwest island. Sail westward to ride the current to the southern of two shallows on Route 133, where you'll need to fight Experts Conor and Mollie before collecting the
Big Pearl
there. Continue westward to reach the south side of Route 133's northwest island, and battle Bird Keeper Beck. Sail west again to battle Sailor Hudson in the shallows of the large island. Head back into the water to follow the current to Slateport City.
To the Depths
Ride the southern currents to fight Fisherman Ronald on the crescent-shaped island, then sail westward to a calm patch of water surrounded by shallows. Grab the
Protein
, then follow the currents westward to be funneled through a bottleneck; this leads to calm waters with two Swimmers, Debra and Franklin. Pass through the rocky southern islet, collecting the
Max Revive
along the way, to reach a rectangular patch of shallow water situated between Routes 133 and 134. Step into the water from the west-central side to reach a deep, dark pit of water surrounded by a ring of rocks.
Dive
beneath the waves and follow the underwater path southward. The markings on the nearby wall are an ancient form of writing, and translate to
Go up here
.
Surface from this point to emerge in an ancient ruin known as the
Sealed Chamber
. Once you're done exploring the Sealed Chamber, surface on Route 134 where you left off and continue west and then south to a small maze of rocks. Leave the maze through its westernmost exit to Sailor Hudson's island, then Surf further west to reach the shallows outside Slateport City.
Sealed Chamber, Entrance
Sealed Chamber, Back Room
Sealed Chamber
The
Sealed Chamber
is a mysterious ruin located in the depths of
Route 134
. The many stone tablets positioned around the chamber feature the same mysterious writing that was found near the underwater entrance. Solving some of
Hoenn
's oldest mysteries hinges on deciphering this age-old system.
Entrance
The first chamber holds ten stone tablets that act as a key to decoding this ancient writing system, known as
Braille
. These 28 characters correspond to the 26 letters of the alphabet, as well as the comma and period. Inspect the markings on the cavern's north wall to reveal a phrase, which translates to
Dig here
. Using
the field move
causes the wall to fall away, granting you access to a second cavern.
Back Room
The central ruins are encircled by
six more stone tablets
which tell of a powerful Pokémon that was sealed away. The message on the north wall reads,
First comes
Wailord
. Last comes
Relicanth
.
Relicanth can be found only in a few underwater areas, while Wailord's pre-evolved form,
Wailmer
, can be found in many areas with the
Good Rod
or
Super Rod
. Position these Pokémon in their respective places in your party and examine the wall again. This causes a mighty earthquake to rock the Sealed Chamber, while the sound of doors opening echoes from somewhere far away. Three separate ruins have now been opened, and each one holds a legendary Pokémon!
Desert Ruins (optional)

Exterior
After climbing through the tunnel from the sea, you emerge on the island's upper level.
Wallace
approaches you from the tower, having just unlocked the door. Sudden earthquakes rock the island as the weather distortions continue to spread from
Sootopolis
. He's worried about the city and heads back, leaving you to scale the tower on your own.
1F-5F
Enter the tower and climb the stairs to 4F. Step onto the cracked tiles on the north side of the floor; this causes you to fall back down to a previously-inaccessible part of 3F. Climb to 5F and take the stairs in the northeast to reach the apex.
Apex
Upon reaching the rooftop, you find the legendary creature beyond one final flight of stairs. Approach the dragon and it awakens, before flying off with a cry loud enough to shake the tower. Follow it back to Sootopolis!
Sootopolis City (second visit)
Rayquaza to the Rescue
Rayquaza quelling the battle.
When you return to
Sootopolis
, you find the two super-ancient Pokémon still locked in battle.
Rayquaza
suddenly appears in a beam of green light shining through the storm clouds, and quickly descends to the city. It hovers above the two combatants, and ends the fighting with a single, intimidating roar.
Groudon
and
Kyogre
flee, Rayquaza flies off back to
Sky Pillar
with another loud cry, and the weather returns to normal. With the super-ancient Pokémon gone, you can now find wild Pokémon while surfing in Sootopolis City.

Sootopolis Gym
Sootopolis Gym, 1F
Sootopolis Gym, B1F
Sootopolis City Pokémon Gym
Leader: Juan
The Gym Leader with the beauty of pure water!
The
Sootopolis Gym
Specializes in
Water-type
Pokémon.
Grass
- and
Electric-type
moves are best here, while
Fire
,
Ground
, and
Rock
Pokémon may struggle. The Gym features three platforms where each icy tile must be traversed once in order to defrost the next stairway. Walking over an ice tile once cracks it; passing by a second time shatters it, leaving you to fall to the Gym's snowy underbelly where plenty of Trainers await.
The first puzzle is a 3×3 grid of ice, with two icy rocks as obstacles. Starting on the south-central tile, move ←1, ↑1, →2, ↑1 and ←1. This reveals the first stairway.
The second puzzle is a 7×3 grid, with two icy rocks as obstacles. From the south-central tile, move ←3, ↑2, →2, ↓1, →2, ↓1, →2, ↑2, and ←3. This reveals the second stairway.
The final puzzle is an 11×4 grid, with six icy rocks as obstacles. Starting on the south-central tile, move ←5, ↑3, →1, ↓1, →1, ↓1, →1, ↑2, →1, ↓1, →1, ↓1, →2, ↑1, →1, ↓1, →1, ↓1, →1, ↑3, and ←5. This reveals the stairway to the Gym Leader.
Juan
leads with his
Luvdisc
; not much of a threat, but it may still confuse its target with
Sweet Kiss
, and further hinder male targets with
Attract
. As a
Water
/
Ground
Pokémon, his
Whiscash
is only vulnerable to Grass moves; its
Rain Dance
temporarily strengthens Water moves, while
Earthquake
can deter
Electric-type
opponents.
Sealeo
's
Ice
/
Water
typing gives it additional weaknesses to
Fighting
and
Rock
moves;
Water Pulse
and
Body Slam
deal damage while
Encore
forces the target to repeat its previous move. His
Crawdaunt
is not a major threat, as all Water moves are
Special moves
and its
Special Attack
is lower than its
Attack
, but it can still deal damage. Finally, his
Kingdra
can inflict serious damage with Water Pulse, and use
Ice Beam
to deal with Grass types; use powerful moves to defeat it quickly, before it can regain health with
Rest
.

Defeated, Juan awards you the
Rain Badge
, which ensures obedience from all Pokémon and enables the use of
Waterfall
in the field. He also gives you
TM03
(
Water Pulse
) as a prize, and registers himself in your PokéNav. With all eight Badges, your next destination is the
Pokémon League
in
Ever Grande City
to the southeast. To get there, sail southward from
Mossdeep City
, then eastward through
Route 128
's narrow channel. However, you may want to pick up a few more items before leaving Sootopolis.
Competitive brothers
In the house northeast of the Pokémon Center, there are two brothers who are arguing over two different species of Pokémon. The younger brother is a Fisherman, while the older brother is a Hiker. The younger brother prefers Seedot and the older brother prefers Lotad.
The brothers are arguing over the sizes of their favorite Pokémon. If a brother is shown a Pokémon of the species he prefers, he will calculate its size and give the player an Elixir if it is larger than any he has seen before.
