Access Denied
A pair of
Team Magma
Grunts are guarding the cable car station, so no one can reach the summit of Mt. Chimney right now. In addition, the elevated terrain makes westward travel impossible, so the only other way forward is a steamy tunnel through the mountainside.
Fiery Path
The sweltering
Fiery Path
, a passage that leads through the base of
Mt. Chimney
, is filled with Pokémon that thrive in the heat. The main passage leads to the north side of

boulders
prevent anyone from exploring the oppressive side tunnels for now.

Speak with the workshop owner to learn how much ash you've collected. By providing him with the correct amounts, he is able to create valuable glass items.

Meet Lanette
Inside the Pokémon Center, you find the PC in use by a woman named
Lanette
. She upgraded the previous version of the
Pokémon Storage System
, adding a user-friendly graphical interface, the ability to store over 400 Pokémon, and the ability to change the
wallpaper
of each Box. As she leaves, she invites you to visit her home on
Route 114
.
Move Tutor
There is a girl inside the Poké Mart, examining the merchandise displayed on the rear wall. Speak to her, and she offers to teach the move
Metronome
to a Pokémon, one time only.
Battle Tent
The
Fallarbor Battle Tent
stands on the north side of town, and is the third of three scattered throughout
Hoenn
. At this location, challengers select three of their Pokémon to battle three opposing Trainers. These Trainers' Pokémon will either be level 30, or match the highest-leveled Pokémon in your party, whichever is higher. Each separate Pokémon face-off has a three-turn limit. If neither Pokémon has been knocked out in that time, the judge makes a ruling that depends on three factors: Mind, the amount of offensive moves; Skill, the accuracy of moves; and Body, the remaining HP. Possible scores for each category include Circle (a win, 2 points), Triangle (a tie, 1 point), and X (a loss, 0 points). The Pokémon that earns the most points wins. The reward for winning three consecutive battles here is a
Hyper Potion
.
Scott
can be found inside the entry hall. He is impressed that you've stopped by, as most people around here are easygoing and laid-back, and urges you to make a challenge.
Move Maniac
The
Move Maniac
lives in the northwest house. This helpful guy knows every move a Pokémon can learn as it grows, and is able to teach forgotten moves to any Pokémon, for a price. He charges a single
Heart Scale
for each move relearned. While a few can be found on the beach as invisible items right now, you will need to wait until you encounter wild
Luvdisc
later on to be able to collect a more steady supply.
Route 114
Route 114
Pockmarked by fallen Meteorites, the lengthy

leads up the mountainside to

. The
Fossil Maniac
lives up north, while
Lanette
