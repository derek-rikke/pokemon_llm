Slateport City
When you arrive in
Slateport
, head straight for the northeast part of town. Outside Slateport Harbor, you find
Captain Stern
wrapping up a TV interview in front of a small crowd. Afterwards, you catch up with him for a little chat where he informs you of his newest discovery. He's found an underwater cavern on
Route 128
, and believes it to be the den of a super-ancient Pokémon long though to have been extinct. Just then, you hear a voice booming out from a megaphone. It's
Archie
, who mocks the captain and thanks him for the
submarine
.
Slateport Harbor
After rushing inside the building, you find
Archie
and a Grunt standing near the sub, ready to depart. He accepts that you won't simply leave him to his plans, and wonders if you will visit their hideout in
Lilycove City
. But he's come too far to be stopped now, and he and the Grunt quickly escape in the sub.
Lilycove City
Lilycove City
A port city,
Lilycove
mirrors
Slateport
with its impressive size, its scenic lighthouse, and its spacious harbor. The main attraction is the
Lilycove Department Store
, while the
Contest Hall
,
Lilycove Museum
, and
Cove Lily Motel
are also located here.

Pokémon Trainer Fan Club
Members of the
Pokémon Trainer Fan Club
discuss popular Pokémon Trainers and Gym Leaders. After entering the
Hall of Fame
, several members announce themselves as your fans, as well.
Cove Lily Motel
Shrine
Team Aqua's hideout on the edge of town has kept most tourists away, bringing the
Cove Lily Motel
's business to a halt. As a result, there's nothing of interest here at the moment. After resolving the conflict with the villainous team and entering the
Hall of Fame
, the Game Freak staff will visit the motel during their trip to Hoenn. The Game Designer will give Trainers the Poké
Diploma
after completing the
Hoenn Pokédex
.
Scott
can be found here on the upper level, but he only appears before Team Aqua steals the
submarine
from Slateport City.
Pokémon Contest Hall
The
Contest Hall
stands on the south side of town. This building hosts all four Contest levels—Normal Rank, Super Rank, Hyper Rank, and Master Rank. A receptionist will give you a
Pokéblock Case
, which lets you enter the
Safari Zone
north of
Route 121
, if you talk to her. Several powerful Pokémon, such as
Girafarig
,
Pinsir
, and
Heracross
, are found in the Safari Zone and nowhere else.
Pokéblock Master's House
The Pokéblock Master's house stands to the north of the harbor. Talk to her and her family to learn tips on crafting potent
Pokéblocks
.
Rival Battle 5 (optional)
When you approach the Department Store, you find
May
/
Brendan
waiting outside blocking the entrance. She/He offers to battle you to determine which Trainer has been doing a better job of raising their Pokémon in a fifth and final battle.

5F: Decoration Floor
The
fifth floor
is dedicated to
Secret Base
fanatics. Here you'll find a wide selection of
Decorations
to deck out your Base, including dolls, mats, posters, and cushions.
Rooftop Plaza
After entering the
Hall of Fame
, the store occasionally holds a
major clearance sale
. A special selection of Secret Base Decorations are offered, with items listed anywhere from
$
200 to
$
10,000. Though this sale rarely occurs, many of the items available for purchase cannot be obtained anywhere else.
Also on the rooftop, a girl fantasizes about copying herself and living several different lives. Speak to her, and she offers to teach the move
Substitute
to a Pokémon, one time only.
Lilycove Museum
The
Lilycove Museum
stands in the northwest part of town. The museum's curator initially blocks the stairs to the second floor because the upper level is empty. He is still searching for modern and vibrant artwork to display there, and asks you to search for such artwork. If you happen to win a Master Rank
Pokémon Contest
with at least 800 points, an artist will approach you saying that he's done a painting that might even look good in a museum, at which point you direct him to the Lilycove Museum. If you collect one painting for each of the five Contest categories, the curator will reward you with a
Glass Ornament
for your
Secret Base
.
Move Deleter's House
The first house to the east of the Department Store is home to the
Move Deleter
, an absent-minded man with the power to make a Pokémon forget any move. This is the only way for a Pokémon to forget an
HM
move. Unlike the
Move Reminder
in
Fallarbor Town
, the Move Deleter's services are free of charge.
A Berry A Day
Speak to the Gentleman to the east of the Move Deleter's house to get one random Berry from a group of ten every day.

Climb out of the water and up the stairway. At the top, a single Aqua Grunt patrols around the pool of water. Battle him and head down the stairs to the northeast.
B1F (west)
There are two warp panels in the northeast room; take the eastern panel first to reach the east-central room and a
Max Elixir
. Warp back and take the other to reach the northwest panel in the southern room. Ignore the three Aqua Grunts and take the warp panel in the southwest.
B1F (east)
The previous warp panel leads to a small room with several more. Follow them in the correct order—left, center, left, left—to reach the interior room on B1F.
B1F (west)
In
Archie
's office, you'll find four items near the far wall. Two of them are actually
Electrode
in disguise, while the bottom-left item is a
Nugget
and the top-left item is a
Master Ball
! This type of Poké Ball will catch any wild Pokémon without fail, and is best used on hard-to-catch legendary Pokémon. Backtrack through the warp-filled hallway to B1F's southern room, battle the three Grunts, and step on the southeast warp panel. This transports you to the north-central room; head down the stairs to the submarine room.
Submarine room
Go south and step on the warp panel there to be transported a short distance to the west; collect the
Nest Ball
from this enclosed area before warping back. Head northeast past another patrolling Aqua Grunt and take the warp panel there to the northwest room. Climb the stairs back to B1F.
B1F (west)
Battle past the single Aqua Grunt here and head down the stairs to the northeast.
Submarine room
Battle the two Aqua Grunts and step on the warp panel to the southwest; this leads to the southeast corner of the submarine room. Go west to find one of the Aqua Admins,
Matt
, standing at the water's edge. He's the only thing standing between you and stopping
Archie
's getaway!

The battle lasted just long enough for Archie to escape in his souped-up submarine. You've got to chase after him to the
Seafloor Cavern
, but you have no means of diving underwater like he can in his sub. For now, you'll have to keep to the surface. Head south then east and take the warp panel there back to the cave entrance and
Lilycove City
. The Grunt and his
Wailmer
blockade have disappeared from the beach, leaving you free to venture out into the eastern ocean.
