Connected to the ocean, the appearance of
Shoal Cave
changes with the
tides
. Seawater floods the cave during high tide, closing off some areas and opening others. It then drains away during low tide, revealing new areas for exploration. The tides change every six hours, at 3:00 and 9:00.

Entrance
An old man in the entry chamber offers to make a
Shell Bell
for your Pokémon. But first, he needs you to collect some of the cave's natural resources:
Shoal Shells
and
Shoal Salts
. These items are replenished each day, so there's no limit to the number you can collect. Once you hand over four of each item, he crafts the health-restoring item for you. Surf northwest and take the doorway there to reach the next chamber.
Second Cavern
Surf along the water in a clockwise direction, collecting the four Shoal Shells and a
Rare Candy
on the way. Take the southeast doorway back to the entrance, where you can collect a
Big Pearl
on the nearby ledge.

Ice Cavern
The final cavern is permanently encased in ice, and the slick floors hinder travel. Go south from the ladder, across two ice patches. At the third ice patch, slide west to the second snow patch within it. Slide north, then west and south to the third small snow patch. Slide south, east, then north to continue on. Slide north to the snow patch near the narrow stairway. Move west then south to a rock, then east and north to the central plateau and the
NeverMeltIce
on its south end. Slide south from the narrow stairway, then west and north to reach the northwest corner. Go east then south to a snow patch, then north to a rock near the room's northwest corner. Head east, south, and west, then move north, west, south, and west to the small snow patch. Slide north, east, then south to reach

Deepest Room, east of the doorway
E
Entrance
When you first enter the cavern, you find
Captain Stern
's sub moored beneath the waves. Rise to the surface and take the north doorway to the next room.
Room 1
This room features two boulders that hinder travel. Go northwest and clear the way with
Rock Smash
, then use
Strength
to move the first boulder southward. Head east and move the second boulder eastward. At this point, there are two paths forward. The northwest doorway leads directly to the southeast part of Room 4. The southeast doorway leads through Rooms 2 and 3 to the southwest part of Room 4.
Room 2
Head south to a fork in the road. Both tunnels lead into the next room, but the western tunnel serves as a shortcut.
Room 3
The doorway to the south merely leads back to the entrance. Instead, go through the northeast doorway.
Room 4
Use
Strength
or
Rock Smash
to clear a path, then move the west-central boulder to the northwest corner. The northwest doorway leads to Room 5, while the northeast doorway leads to Room 6.
Room 5
This room has many strong water currents.
Surf
out into the water and ride the currents to a calm spot a short distance to the northeast. Sail east to ride the current to a patch of calm water to the northeast. Go east again to follow the current around the rock outcropping to the west side of the room. Surf westward and take the current to the northwest doorway.
Room 6
This room has many strong water currents. Surf eastward along the south wall to the second current, which leads a short distance northward. Go north from here to reach the west side of the room. Sail north once more to follow the current back and forth on the room's north side. Climb onto shore and go through the northwest doorway.
Room 7
The room splits into two tunnels before converging near the next doorway. The room's east side is littered with boulders, while the west side is clear, aside from
Shelly
and an Aqua Grunt. She's looking for payback for what happened in the
Weather Institute
, and draws you into battle!

Room 8
There are a dozen boulders here to block progress. Start off by moving the south-central boulder one step northward and the other two southern-most boulders farther apart. Push the first boulder one step westward, then shove the middle boulder one step northward. Move the boulders on the left and right farther apart, then push both the north-northwest and north-northeast boulders to the north wall. Finally, push the middle boulder to either side to reach the doorway.
Deepest Room
Go east to find

Earthquake
) on the room's highest level before continuing along the downward-sloping corridor.
Team Aqua
's driven leader,
Archie
suddenly runs up to you. Like
Maxie
did with
Groudon
, Archie has discovered the super-ancient Pokémon,
Kyogre
, and stands ready to restore the creature with his stolen
Red Orb
. With his plan so close to fruition, he's not about to let anything stop him, and drags you into battle.

Even defeated, Archie reaffirms his intent to revive the super-ancient Pokémon. While talking, the
Red Orb
suddenly shines brightly, awakening
Kyogre
. Like
Groudon
before it, the Pokémon flees. Just then, Archie receives an urgent call from his subordinates outside. The great energy generated by the legendary creature has altered and intensified
Hoenn
's weather as expected, but to dangerous, unforeseen levels. The weather's dramatic shift to a strange mix of heavy rain and harsh sunlight influences any battles on the region's east side.
Maxie
and a pair of his Grunts enter a moment later. He condemns
Team Aqua
's actions and tries to reason with Archie, who counters by criticizing
Team Magma
for disturbing Groudon.
Route 128
Archie talking to the player about the weather.
The group returns to the surface, where they witness the extreme weather firsthand. Kyogre's power has surpassed expectations, forcing Archie to grudgingly agree to work with Maxie to set things right. Once the others leave,
Steven
swoops down to assess the situation. He informs you that the oppressive weather seems to originate in
Sootopolis City
to the northwest. He's headed there to investigate, and suggests you do the same.
Note that abnormal weather only occurs in Lilycove City, Mossdeep City,
Sootopolis City
,
Ever Grande City
, and the Routes 124, 125,
Route 126
, 127 and 128. Go to the Route 126 which is located to south from Route 124. Additionally, if you return to
Lilycove
, the
department store's rooftop
will be closed because of the weather conditions.
