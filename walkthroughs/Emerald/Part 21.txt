After you climb aboard,
Scott
will come and tell you that someone like you should visit the Battle Frontier and he's already made arrangements with the ship's captain to let you visit there anytime. After that, you can find
Mr. Briney
and
Peeko
on the north side of the ship. The two are happy to be back out on the seas, and even more so now that Briney has been made the ship's honorary captain!
There are eight cabins on the main floor with three cabins on each side holding Trainers who are anxious to battle. On the south side, the second cabin from the left is your own, with a bed where you can rest your Pokémon. If you're going from Slateport to Lilycove, the ship will reach its destination after you sleep once, but if you're going from Lilycove to Slateport you'll need two rests until you arrive. On the north side, the farthest cabin to the right holds a Poké Maniac who gives you

Basement
Head downstairs to visit the ship's spacious storage. There's plenty of room for Pokémon battles to play out, and the two hardworking Sailors here will happily oblige. Be sure to search the trash cans to discover some
Leftovers
, as well.
The Battle Frontier beckons!
After you reach your destination, exit the ship and board it once again. This time, choose to go to the Battle Frontier!
Battle Frontier
Battle Frontier
Inside the Battle Factory
The great
Battle Frontier
was built to provide a challenge to all those able to defeat the Pokémon League, with the best and brightest Trainers from across the region competing here to determine who among them is the strongest. The small island that once held only the
Battle Tower
has been developed to include seven facilities in all. These are, from west to east: the Battle Factory, Battle Dome, Battle Pike, Battle Tower, Battle Arena, Battle Palace, and Battle Pyramid. Each facility is headed by a
Frontier Brain
, elite Trainers who have mastered the art of battling under their respective rule sets.

Entrance
Overview
When you first enter the Battle Frontier, a woman at the entrance issues you a
Frontier Pass
. This pass holds your Trainer Card, a small map of the Frontier, and all records of your exploits here; this includes the number of accumulated
Battle Points
earned, and any of the seven
Frontier Symbols
won. One battle from any facility may be recorded and stored on the Frontier Pass to be viewed or overwritten at any time.
Battle Points are earned by winning a set number of battles in any facility, usually in small amounts, but gradually growing through each consecutive streak. Defeating the Frontier Brain for the first time earns challengers the Silver Symbol of that facility, as well as 10BP. The second defeat of the same Brain earns the challenger the facility's Gold Symbol and another 10BP. The Frontier Brain will only appear in 3-vs-3 Single Battle mode.
Restrictions
No two Pokémon may hold the same item, and items may not be used from the
Bag
during battle (except in the
Battle Pyramid
). Battles conducted in the Frontier do not award any experience or prize money. The following Pokémon cannot be entered for battle:
Mewtwo
,
Mew
,
Lugia
,
Ho-Oh
,
Celebi
,
Kyogre
,
Groudon
,
Rayquaza
,
Jirachi
,
Deoxys
(Speed Forme) and
Egg
.
Scott's House
Scott resides in a house located between the Battle Dome and Battle Tower, and will give you various rewards as you progress through the Battle Frontier. When you first arrive at the Battle Frontier, Scott will award you with 1, 2, or 3 BP depending on the how many times you spoke (11 in total) throughout the game.
Battle Factory
The
Battle Factory
stands in the southwest corner of the island. Unlike the other facilities, the Battle Factory is less interested about a Trainer's ability to battle and more interested in researching a Trainer's capacity to use
rental Pokémon
. The Battle Factory functions the same way as the
Battle Tent
in
Slateport City
. Before each battle, challengers learn a bit of info about the upcoming opponent, and may switch one of their rental Pokémon with one used by the previous opponent.
A Trainer's battle style is based on the moves of his or her Pokémon. Certain moves fall under
one of seven categories
. Depending on the number of moves from each category a Trainer's team has, his or her battle style will be described differently.
Upon reaching the 21st and 42nd battle in a streak,
Noland
will appear and challenge you to a battle. Like all other Trainers here, his rental Pokémon are completely random. Defeat him to earn the
Knowledge Symbol
.
Battle Dome
Inside the Battle Dome
The
Battle Dome
is located in the island's northwest corner. Inside, tournaments between 16 Trainers are held. Before each battle, Trainers learn a bit about their opponent, including their Pokémon, battle style, and how they train. Then, both Trainers choose two Pokémon from their three-Pokémon party to use in battle. Competitors can learn who was eliminated in each round by viewing the tournament bracket.
Upon winning five and ten championships,
Tucker
will appear and challenge you to a battle. Defeat him to earn the
Tactics Symbol
.

Battle Pike
Inside the Battle Pike
The outside of the
Battle Pike
is designed like a
Seviper
. There are 21 rooms inside, in seven sets of three. Challengers may choose any of the three in a set to continue through, and in each room, any one of eight events may occur. A woman standing outside each room hints as to what is in one of the three rooms.
Single battle: A Trainer with 3 Pokémon walks up to the challenger and battles.
Double battle: Two Trainers with 1 Pokémon each will team up and battle the player. This room will not appear if the player already has two fainted Pokémon.
Hard single battle and healing: 3 Pokémon per side against a higher-tier opponent; winner's Pokémon are completely healed.

Battle Arena
Inside the Battle Arena
The
Battle Arena
is located to the southeast of the Battle Tower. Inside, two Pokémon are pitted against each other for three rounds. If neither Pokémon was defeated in that time, they are then rated on their battle proficiency in three categories. The Pokémon with the higher score wins, and the Pokémon with the lower score leaves the battlefield. A tie results in both Pokémon leaving the battlefield. A knockout means an automatic win for the Pokémon still standing.
Similar to the
Battle Tent
in
Fallarbor Town
, Pokémon are rated on their Mind, Skill, and Body. The Pokémon with the better rating in each category earns two points, while a tie earns a single point for each Pokémon.
Mind highlights a Pokémon's offensive style. One point is earned for each damage-dealing attack chosen (except
Counter
,
Mirror Coat
, and
Bide
), and a single point is lost if either
Protect
,
Detect
, or
Endure
is chosen. No other moves award points. Only the move selection matters; even if the Pokémon does not actually use the move (due to an effect such as
paralysis
), it will still score in this category. The Pokémon with the higher rating earns an additional two points for the overall judgment.
Skill focuses on a Pokémon's accuracy. One point is earned for each attack that lands successfully, while two points are deducted if the move misses, fails, or is prevented from executing due to an effect such as paralysis. If the move was caused to fail by
Protect
,
Detect
, or flinching from
Fake Out
, however, no points are deducted. Hitting a move
super effectively
rewards two points rather than one, but dealing not very effective damage instead deducts one point. The Pokémon with the higher rating earns an additional two points for the overall judgment.
Body focuses on the amount of HP remaining after three rounds compared to the total HP at the beginning. The Pokémon with the better ratio earns an additional two points for the overall judgment.
Upon reaching 28 and 56 wins,
Greta
will appear and challenge you to a battle. Defeat her to earn the

Battle Palace
Inside the Battle Palace
The
Battle Palace
stands in the southeast corner of the island. Like the
Verdanturf
Battle Tent
, Pokémon battles conducted here see Pokémon left to their own devices, with no outside commands from their Trainers. A Pokémon's battle style depends on its
Nature
, and may change when its HP gets low.
All moves belong to one of three categories: Attack, Defense, or Support. Defense moves are all moves that target the user. Support moves are all non-damaging moves that don't fall in the Defense category. Attack moves are all moves not listed under Defense or Support.
Each Nature has a different ratios that determine how often a Pokémon with that Nature is likely to use Attack, Defense, or Support moves. These ratios change when the Pokémon's HP falls below 50%. During each turn of battle, a category is selected, and a random attack of that category is chosen from the Pokémon's moveset. If no such move exists, the Pokémon will appear "incapable of using its power", and skip its turn.
Upon completing a winning streak of 21 and 42 battles,

Battle Pyramid
Inside the Battle Pyramid
The
Battle Pyramid
stands tall on the island's northeast corner. There are seven floors, each one shrouded in darkness that can only be dispelled by defeating opponents on each floor. Challengers cannot take any items into the pyramid, and items found inside can only be used inside. These items are stored in a special Bag, the Battle Bag, that is loaned to each challenger at the entrance. The Battle Bag has enough room for ten different items, and up to 99 of each. If the challenger is victorious, the Battle Bag stores these items for the next battle; upon defeat, the Battle Bag's contents return to one
Hyper Potion
and one
Ether
. If at any point the challenger acquires more than 10 different items, extra items must be discarded.
Wild Pokémon may be encountered within the pyramid, with strategies differing depending on how many floors the challenger has ventured through. A Hex Maniac next to the PC will tell challengers what to expect from the upcoming floor. These themes range from certain types of Pokémon, Pokémon with moves that inflict status ailments, and Pokémon with certain Abilities.
After completing 21 floors and 70 floors,
Brandon
appears at the peak and challenges you to a battle. Defeat him to earn the
Brave Symbol

Other Areas
The Odd Tree
Southeast of the Battle Palace, there is an odd tree standing atop the waterfall that actually moves to avoid water. Use the
Wailmer Pail
to disturb it, and the tree attacks! It turns out to be a
Sudowoodo
, a Pokémon more akin to a rock than a tree.
Artisan Cave
Artisan Cave entrance
Artisan Cave, B1F
Artisan Cave, 1F
Artisan Cave
is a network of tunnels that link one end of the island to the other. The entrance is located to the south, and is accesible after defeat Sudowoodo or catch it, you'll have access to the water behind it, surf on it, go down the waterfall, and go all the way to the west. The exit leads to a ledge just east of the Battle Tower. Only
Smeargle
can be found inside, and its
signature move
,
Sketch
, lets it copy nearly any other move permanently. When paired with a compatible female, this allows a male Smeargle to pass on nearly any move to the resulting offspring.

Time for a Trade
A small building stands just west of the Battle Tower. Speak to the woman inside, and she asks to trade her
Meowth
for your
Skitty
. Meowth cannot be found anywhere in the wild, while Skitty are found on
Route 116
.
Ranking Hall
Record Hall
The Ranking Hall is located on the island's north side, between the Battle Tower and Battle Pyramid. There are three rooms inside. Records for the Battle Factory, Battle Dome, and Battle Pike are displayed in the left room. The center room holds records for the Battle Tower. Records for the Battle Arena, Battle Palace, and Battle Pyramid are displayed in the right room.
Double or Nothing
In the building to the south of the Battle Pyramid, there are several people placing bets on which challengers they expect to clear certain facilities. After earning three Silver Symbols, one of the men will ask that you compete in a random facility, which changes daily. He then asks that you chip in some Battle Points—either 5, 10, or 15—and if you emerge victorious, he pays you back with twice that amount. If not, the Battle Points you gave him are lost.
Stats Judge
In the building behind the Pokémon Center is
an old man
who can
judge
one of your Pokémon's stats. He first describes the Pokémon's overall ability, which is based on the sum of its six
IVs
. He then indicates which stat is highest, and which range it falls under.
Move Tutors
Southwest of the Battle Dome is a building with two elderly women inside. Both women are
Move Tutors
, and each one offers to teach any of ten different moves to a Pokémon. Prices range from 16 to 48
Battle Points
