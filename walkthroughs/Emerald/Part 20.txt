S.S. Ticket
From Norman, after defeating the Elite Four and Champion for the first time
E
National Pokédex
From
Professor Birch
in his lab, after entering the Hall of Fame
E
Home
When the credits conclude, you awaken in your room back in
Littleroot Town
. Head downstairs and
Norman
hands you a gift from
Mr. Briney
—the
S.S. Ticket
. With this, you can ride
Captain Stern
's new ferry! Norman suggests taking the ferry from either
Slateport
or
Lilycove
, then heads back to the
Petalburg Gym
.
The Eon Pokémon
After Norman leaves, a breaking news story flashes across the TV screen; it seems that a certain unnamed Pokémon has been spotted flying around the region. The reporter informs viewers of the Pokémon's color, but static interference prevents you from learning it. After viewing this report, Mom asks which color it was, giving you the choice of red or blue. Depending on your choice, you will be able to encounter the legendary Pokémon
Latias
or
Latios
, respectively,
roaming
across Hoenn.
The Pokémon moves to a different area every time you change locations. The easiest way to see Latios/Latias for the first time is to first fly to
Slateport City
. Once there, put a Pokémon with a certain level (make sure it is above 13 and below 40) as first conscious member of your party. Once that is done, go to the route above Slateport City (Route 110) and spray Max Repel. Next, use the Mach Bike around for 5 seconds in the grass next to the entrance of
Cycling Road
. After that, enter to Cycling Road then go back to that patch of grass to repeat the process. The repel helps you save time from encountering Pokémon other than Latios/Latias but still lets you find Latios/Latias because it is not a higher level than 40 (starting level for Latios/Latias). To make matters more difficult, Latios/Latios will also attempt to flee on the first turn of battle. These Pokémon are probably the best one to use your
Master Ball
on but if you already used yours or you don't want to, there are some strategies you can utilize. A good way to prevent them from running away is to send out a faster Pokémon like
Crobat
to use a trapping move like
Mean Look
(
Zubat
learns this move at level 36.) Likewise, the move
Wrap
also works. Your Pokémon should be equipped with a
Quick Claw
. Another option is start the battle with a
Wobbuffet
due to its
Shadow Tag
ability. If Latios/Latias is afflicted by a status condition, it will retain this ailment when it is next encountered. After meeting it for the first time, the Pokédex tracks its movements.

Professor Birch's Lab
National Pokédex
Professor Birch
and your
rival
are waiting outside your house. Birch takes both of you to his lab, where he upgrades your
Pokédexes
to
National Pokédex
mode. Shortly after leaving the lab, you'll get a call from
Scott
.
Johto Starter Pokemon
Be sure to visit Professor Birch in his Lab again once you have caught
all 200 Pokémon
in the
Hoenn
regional Pokédex
. Once he verifies that you are indeed successful, he offers you a gift to start you on your quest to complete the
National Pokédex
listing. This gift is the choice between one of three starter Pokémon of the distant
Johto
region:
Chikorita
,
Cyndaquil
, and
Totodile

Gym Leaders and Wally rematches
After receiving the National Pokédex,
Wally
and the
Gym Leaders
can request
rematches
through the
PokéNav
's Match Call.
The Gym Leaders can be rematched to a
Double Battle
, and the only way to rematch with them is to wait until they are ready. Here the Match Call will alert you.
Wally can be repeatedly rematched once per day and they will take place near the exit of the Victory Road. He is the only opponent which the Match Call doesn't alert you about a rematch.
Trick House - Puzzle 8
In
Trick House
now you can complete the puzzle 8. You can get the
Nugget
in the Trick Master's Room.
Altering Cave
Altering Cave
Back on
Route 103

Trainer Hill
Trainer Hill
Trainer Hill
is located to the east of the Winstrate home. This tower was designed for challengers to race through as quickly as possible, battling four floors of Trainers on the way to the rooftop. The ground floor holds both a Pokémon Center and Poké Mart (the seller upgrade their inventory due you entered the
Hall of Fame
), so Trainers can be well-prepared for the trial ahead. There are four different modes—Normal, Variety, Unique, and Expert—with each one more difficult than the last. A challenger's Pokémon will not be healed by the staff, but recovery items like Potions may be used during and between battles. Prizes vary depending on the amount of time elapsed, and all battles conducted here are
Double Battles
. No experience or prize money is awarded.

Desert Underpass
Fly
back to

and head west to
Route 114
to pay a visit to the
Fossil Maniac
in his home just outside of town. His constant digging for new Fossils has caused the wall to collapse, revealing a long, sandy tunnel stretching far to the east. This is the
Desert Underpass
, which leads through the mountains of northern Hoenn before ending beneath the desert of
Route 111
. At the tunnel's end, you find the remaining Fossil that fell beneath the sands when
Mirage Tower
disappeared. There are also a handful of Pokémon species to be found here, including
Ditto
, which can't be found anywhere else. This Pokémon is unique as its only move,
Transform
, allows it to become a nearly-identical copy of the target. But it's even more useful outside of battle. When left in the Day Care building on
Route 117
with nearly any other Pokémon, the pair are able to produce an Egg containing the other Pokémon's first-stage form! This makes it incredibly useful when working to complete the Pokédex.

Safari Zone
The Safari Zone
The
Safari Zone
gives Trainers a chance to encounter all kinds of Pokémon. It is only open to Trainers participating in the
Safari Game
, where Trainers must use unconventional tactics to try to catch these Pokémon. Admission is
$
500, and entrants are given 30
Safari Balls
to be used and a limit of 500 steps taken before the game is over. The varied terrain means that some areas are only accessible by
Acro Bike
or
Mach Bike
.
The four quadrants to the north and west of the building are open to any Trainer who received a
Pokéblock Case
. Once you upgrade to the National Pokédex, the construction of the two eastern areas will be complete. You can return to the
Safari Zone
and catch some Pokémon native to
Johto
.

Safari Game
In a Safari Game, Trainers must use unconventional tactics to catch wild Pokémon. Rather than use your own Pokémon in battle, you are only allowed to throw
Pokéblocks
to entice the target, making it less likely to run; or go near, which makes the target easier to catch but more likely to run.
In addition, there are several Pokéblock feeders scattered throughout the park. Each feeder can accept a single Pokéblock at a time. Any Pokémon encountered in the feeder's range of five steps will have a Nature that is attracted to that type of Pokéblock. The feeder's effect dissipates after 100 steps are taken.
The Super-Ancient Pokémon
Weather Institute
Return to
Route 119
and pay a visit to the
Weather Institute
. Speak to the meteorologist on the second floor to learn that he has been tracking weather patterns across
Hoenn
. He's even found an unusual weather system localized to a certain area. Routes
114
,
115
,
116
, and
118
have been suffering under severe drought, while Routes
105
,
125
,
127
, and
129
have become prone to heavy thunderstorms. The existence of these unusual conditions indicates the presence of
Groudon
and
Kyogre
, hidden away in a new home that it's made for itself. But these ancient Pokémon are fickle and won't stay put for long, so hurry off to the specified route and you may stumble across a legend!
Terra Cave
Terra Cave, entrance
Terra Cave, interior
After learning of a severe drought on Hoenn's west side, you need to visit the specified route in order to track down
Terra Cave
. Be aware that if it appears on
Route 114
, you will need to scale the waterfall to access it. Enter the cave and proceed to the second chamber, where you find a long tunnel with
Groudon
sitting in a pool of magma at its end. Be sure to save the game before you approach it, as it will disappear if you happen to defeat it. Its
