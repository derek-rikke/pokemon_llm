Relic Recovery!
The tower's top floor holds two treasures from the ancient past. The
Root Fossil
and
Claw Fossil
belong to two species that once lived in the primordial ocean. The researchers at
Devon Corporation
back in
Rustboro
are able to revive any Fossil they receive into a long-lost Pokémon. The Root Fossil becomes the
Rock

Grass

, while the Claw Fossil turns into the
Rock
/
Bug
Anorith
. Choose carefully! After removing either one, the tower begins to shake, and you fall from the building, landing just outside the entrance. The tower disappears down into the dunes, and the remaining Fossil falls away into the shifting sands.
Back to Petalburg City
Now that you've claimed your fourth Badge and combed the desert for treasure, your next stop is
Petalburg City
. The city is far to the southwest, but there are multiple ways to get there.
Head northwest around the volcano to
Fallarbor Town
, then south through
Meteor Falls
to return to Rustboro.
Go south from the desert to
Mauville City
, then west to
Verdanturf Town
. Cut through
Rusturf Tunnel
to return to Rustboro.
Go further south to
Slateport City
and then to
Route 109
, and
Mr. Briney
will take you to
Route 104
.
Once in Rustboro, be sure to stop by
Devon Corporation
. Take your Fossil to the second floor of the Devon Corporation building, and give it to a scientist there for him to restore. Exit the room, come back in, and receive your newly resurrected Pokémon.

After defeating the Petalburg Gym
TM42
(
Facade

From Norman upon his defeat

HM03
(
Surf

Obtained from
Wally
's father after defeating Norman
E
Petalburg Gym
Petalburg Gym
Petalburg City Pokémon Gym
Leader: Norman
A man in pursuit of power!
The
Petalburg Gym
, which specializes in
Normal-type
Pokémon, is styled as a traditional dojo with multiple rooms. Each room has a single Trainer who uses a certain strategy. The sign on each door gives a clue to the strategy of the Trainer in the room behind it. Rather than relying on items, each Trainer's strategy depends on the moves of their Pokémon. The first two rooms beyond the lobby are labeled "Speed" and "Accuracy". The three rooms farther on are named "Confusion", "Defense", and "Recovery". The final two rooms before the Gym Leader are labeled "Strength" and "One-Hit KO". A minimum of three Gym Trainers must be defeated to reach the Gym Leader.
Fighting
types like
Combusken
and
Breloom
will give you the upper hand here.
In the final room, your father has been waiting for you. Now that you have earned four other Badges, he is ready to accept your challenge.
Norman
leads with his
Spinda
;
Teeter Dance
allows it to confuse the target.
Fighting
Pokémon should watch out for its
Psybeam
! His
Vigoroth
is so restless that it can't sleep, due to its
Vital Spirit
Ability. While not a serious threat, it may land a critical hit with
Slash
.
Linoone
can be a serious problem, as
Belly Drum
halves its HP in order to boost its Attack by a whopping 300%! Luckily, the move fails if the user's HP has fallen below 50%.
Slaking
usually leads with
Yawn
. Although Slaking can use its extremely dangerous 160 base
Attack stat
to overpower most Pokémon, its
Truant
lets you completely shut it down with
Dig
or
Protect
. Additionally, if you switch out your Pokémon (possibly to keep Yawn from working), your replacement will be safe for one turn. All four of Norman's Pokémon know
Facade
, which doubles in power if the user is
Burned
,
Poisoned
, or
Paralyzed
, though the
Attack
penalty incurred by sustaining a Burn still applies.

Wally's House
Afterwards, your father awards you the
Balance Badge
, which boosts your Pokémon's
Defense
by 10% and enables the use of
Surf
in the field. He also hands you
TM42
(
Facade
) as a gift. Just then,
Wally
's father bursts in, claiming that he's got something to give you. He leads you next door to his home, where he apologizes for his hasty behavior. He tells you that living in
Verdanturf
has done wonders for Wally's health, and he gives you
HM03
(
Surf
) as thanks for helping the young Trainer. In battle,
Surf
is a strong
Water-type
attack; in the field, it allows you to cross bodies of water. If you're not in a hurry, then consider using your new HM move to explore some of the
water routes
that Hoenn has to offer.
Trainers Rematches
Starting now, your
PokéNav
will start showing that
some trainers
want
rematches
with you. They will be marked by a square Poké Ball in the Match Call feature. Note that the more often you travel on the route or cave where any of these unique Trainers are located, the greater chance the trainer in that area will be ready for a rematch.
Now that you can use Surf (optional)
You can meet many new trainers and find many new items by crossing the ponds and seas scattered throughout Hoenn. When you're ready to cross the sea, approach the coastline and use
Surf
. Hop on your seafaring Pokémon's back to glide across the water. While Surfing, it is impossible to use the field moves
Cut
,
Strength
, or
Rock Smash
; however,
several
other
moves
are allowed. The Itemfinder can't be used while crossing the waves, but you can use an
Escape Rope
or a fishing rod while doing so.
Also now that you have Surf, Mr. Briney will no longer transport you between his house on Route 104 to Dewford Town, or Route 109, instead you'll have to transport yourself using Surf.
