Almost as soon as you enter, two members of the
Shadow Triad
appear and escort you to
N
. He warns you that
Team Plasma
is waiting ahead to test you, then leaves.
Head north to meet up with
Bianca
and
Professor Juniper
. The professor is here to research
Klink
, and Bianca is acting as her bodyguard. Juniper gives you the
Lucky Egg
, which boosts a Pokémon's experience.
Walk around Bianca and shove the floating stone to the left; it flies over to a larger stone on the ground, clearing a path. Go north and push the next rock to the right, and pick up the
Parlyz Heal
. Fight
Scientist
Ronald, grab the
Revive
behind the two floating stones, and continue north to reach a
Heal Ball
on a ledge. Shove the next two floating stones to the west, then south. Bianca and the professor catch up and talk more about
Klink
. You can't go very far north with another floating stone in the way, so go south to the bridge. The
Shadow Triad
appears again, telling you that
Team Plasma
is waiting downstairs. Pick up the
Hyper Potion
to the north and shove the floating stone to the south. Fight
Scientist
Naoko, loop around to the west, and push the southern stone west to get an
Iron
.
B1F
Head to the west and talk to the two brothers to get a
Nugget
from each of them. Continue west to find a
Parlyz Heal
hidden in the alcove, and take the stairs back to the first floor to grab a hidden
HP Up
. Go north past the Nugget Brothers to find a
Timer Ball
. Defeat
Doctor
Wayne to the east to rest your Pokémon, and track down a
Revive
hidden on the wall west of him. Fight your way north past the five
Plasma
grunts. Go west and push another two floating stones to reach a
Thunderstone
and the stairs to the bottom floor.
B2F
Push the floating stone to the right and continue south. Climb down the stairway near
Ace Trainer
Stella to find a
Hyper Potion
, and a
Star Piece
hidden on the wall nearby. Follow the narrow path around to find a
Rare Candy
, then backtrack to the center of the floor. Hunt down a
Parlyz Heal
hidden near the east wall, and get the
BrightPowder
from the northeast chamber. Climb back upstairs to B1F.
B1F
Fight one last
Plasma
grunt and climb the eastern stairs.
1F
Go west past
Scientist
Orville and push the floating stone, then check the wall nearby for a hidden
Max Potion
. Head southeast to fight
Ace Trainer
Corky, then pick up the
Magnet
south of him.
Go east through the last tunnel, and you'll find
N
waiting for you. He says that he wants to find out what kind of dream you have, and he'll do it by battling you.

reminder girl
, on the other hand, can make a Pokémon remember any forgotten move in exchange for a
Heart Scale
.
Meet the other Juniper
A man approaches you when you head north past the Pokémon Center. He introduces himself as
Cedric Juniper
,
Professor Juniper
's father. To commemorate your first meeting, he upgrades your
Pokédex
with new search features, and a function that lets you now view a Pokémon's different forms, and even its
Shiny
form!
He introduces you to
Skyla
, the Mistralton Gym Leader. She's off to check on a sick Pokémon atop the
Celestial Tower
. You won't be able to challenge the Gym until you meet her at the tower, so follow her north to
Route 7
.
Route 7
Route 7
Route 7
is overgrown with patches of tall grass. A series of elevated walkways offer a safer alternative, but you will fall if you miss a step or stop for too long. In a house to the west is a
Hiker
who is looking to trade for a
Boldore
; if you've got one to spare, he offers his
Emolga
for it.
Make your way north to reach the
Celestial Tower
.

When you reach the rooftop,
Skyla
has already helped the weakened Pokémon. Since you've come so far, she asks you to ring the bell. The character of the person ringing the bell is supposed to be reflected in its sound. After listening to the tone, Skyla says you are a kind and strong person, and invites you back to
Mistralton
for a Gym battle.
Mistralton Gym
Mistralton Gym
Mistralton City Pokémon Gym
Leader: Skyla
The Highflying Girl
The
Mistralton Gym
is set up inside an aircraft hangar, and specializes in the
Flying-type
. The Gym features a series of cannons that challengers must use to reach the Gym Leader. All Pokémon here are vulnerable to
Electric
- and
Rock-type
attacks; if you don't have any of these moves, you may want to use TMs to teach moves like
Volt Switch
or
Rock Tomb
.
Climb inside the first cannon, then go left to reach the second. Walk down the staircase and jump in the second cannon again to get shot to the east, landing near
Worker
Cliff. Climb up the staircase and go south to fight
Worker
Brady. Jump inside the third cannon to land on the west side, and battle
Pilot
Ted. Climb in the fourth cannon from the south, and you'll land just short of
Skyla
's platform. The fifth cannon will launch you to the east, then backtrack and battle
Pilot
Chase, and fly to the west. Walk up the staircase to fight
Worker
Arnold, then use the next four cannons to fly south, east, north, then west onto Skyla's platform.

This battle will go quickly if you've got a strong
Electric
-type. If not,
Rock
-types will also do the trick, although you have to watch out for
Swanna
's
Water
-type attacks.
Upon her defeat,
Skyla
awards you the
Jet Badge
, which makes all Pokémon up to level 70 obey you. She also hands over
TM62
(
Acrobatics
).
Outside the Gym,
N
is waiting for you. He tells you that
Ghetsis
is searching for the
Light Stone
and the
Dark Stone
, each said to hold the essence of a legendary Pokémon. Before he leaves, he announces that he will resurrect and befriend one of the legendary dragons, so the world will recognize him as the hero of legend.
