Once you've gathered all the items, return to
Route 8
. Go south through the marsh, and turn east when you reach the Trainer Tips sign. Talk to the first
Parasol Lady
to get
TM42
(
Facade
). The Parasol Lady behind the sign will give you either a
Damp Rock
, a
Heat Rock
, a
Smooth Rock
, or an
Icy Rock
, depending on the time of day you speak to her. Visit her again for a few days to get each item.
When you try to enter the
Tubeline Bridge
to continue east,
Bianca
appears and starts talking to you. She says that there is a lot that she wants to do, but first she needs to know more about Pokémon, so she challenges you to a battle.
