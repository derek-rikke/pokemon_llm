Meet Alder, Champion of Unova
Elesa
shows up after your battle with
Cheren
, and leads the two of you towards the drawbridge. On the way, the three meet a man with wild red hair, who Elesa introduces as
Alder
, the Champion of
Unova
. Cheren tells Alder his goal of becoming Champion, but can't answer why. Alder asks the two of you to battle a pair of
Preschoolers
, and teaches Cheren that some people are happy just being with Pokémon.
Continuing to the west,
Elesa
contacts
someone in Driftveil City
in order to lower the drawbridge. Follow
Cheren
across the bridge.
The hungry maid
The maid inside the camper is trying to cook a meal, but is looking for more ingredients. If you give her
any edible item
, she will pay you for your generosity. She pays more for each item than any Poké Mart does, ranging anywhere from
$
20 to
$
30,000.
Driftveil Drawbridge
Driftveil Drawbridge
Thanks to
Elesa
and
Clay
, Trainers are now free to come and go across the
Driftveil Drawbridge
. The bridge is managed by Clay, the Driftveil Gym Leader, and is raised and lowered to accommodate
Driftveil
's shipping schedule. Bird Pokémon frequently pass over the bridge, and may drop a few
feathers
. Most of the time these contain a
random item
where most of them can be used to raise the Pokémon's
Effort values
for their stats. Since most of these items can be sold for
$
1500 at a
Poké Mart
, this location can also be useful to help make some quick cash to help with purchasing expensive items such as the
TMs
which the Poké Mart sells in various areas.
Ducklett
likes to rest on the bridge, and may be battled occasionally.
Driftveil City
Driftveil City
Driftveil City
is a major port city, and various goods come and go here. The city features the fifth Gym and a market, and one resident will offer to teach your starter Pokémon a special move.

Meet Clay, Driftveil Gym Leader
When you enter the city, you meet up with
Cheren
and
Clay
, the Gym Leader. Clay is upset because when he lowered the drawbridge for the two of you to cross, a group of
Team Plasma
grunts that he had in custody escaped. Clay asks the two of you to find the escapees.
Driftveil Move Tutor
If you have a strong bond with your starter Pokémon, the man in the house east of the market will offer to teach it a special move. The three possible moves are
Grass Pledge
,
Fire Pledge
, and
Water Pledge
. These attacks are decent on their own, but if used simultaneously in a
Double
or
Triple Battle
, their power increases and they create special effects.
Get a Shell Bell
Stop in the house to the southeast of the Pokémon Center and speak to the elderly man to get a
Shell Bell
. When the Pokémon holding it inflicts damage to an opponent, it restores HP equal to 1/8 of the damage dealt.
The kid in the same house is looking to trade. If you can part with a
Minccino
, he'll trade you a
Basculin
.
A Heart Scale a Day
The woman in the house north of the market wants to see a Pokémon that knows a specific move. If you show her any Pokémon with that move, she will thank you by giving you a
Heart Scale
. Heart Scales can be used later to help a Pokémon relearn a move it had forgotten. She will ask to see another move every day.

, it seems that a few grunts have fled into the refrigerated building on the south side of the island.

(
Scald
). Battle with
Worker
Victor, and continue to the right across the second ice patch. Climb up the ladder near Worker Glenn, and slide around in a counter-clockwise loop to continue south. Climb up the next ladder and walk across the wooden containers to reach the building's southeast corner. Battle Worker Patton and grab the
Ice Heal
, then go north across the ice. Grab the
Hyper Potion
near Worker Ryan, and go to the left to reach an open container by the rear wall. Inside is Zinzolin, one of the
Seven Sages
, who has been keeping warm by huddling in the middle of a group of
Team Plasma Grunts
. When he sees you and Cheren enter, he orders them to defend him. Once you each defeat four of the eight grunts,
Clay
arrives with a group of
Workers
to take the thugs back into custody. He invites you to challenge his Gym, then he and Cheren leave. Pick up the
NeverMeltIce
and head back to the city.
Driftveil Gym
When you arrive at the Gym, you see that
Ghetsis
has shown up with a gang of
Plasma
grunts to persuade
Clay
to release the others. Clay reluctantly releases Zinzolin and the others, and the criminals disappear.
Driftveil Gym
Driftveil City Pokémon Gym
Leader: Clay
The Underground Boss
The
Driftveil Gym
specializes in the
Ground-type
. Keeping with his title "Miner King", the Gym incorporates a large mine shaft with
Clay
waiting at the bottom. Since the Pokémon here are vulnerable to
Grass
- and
Water-type
attacks,
TM86
(
Grass Knot
) and
TM55
(
Scald
) can help exploit those weaknesses. For dealing with
Excadrill
, it would be wise to finish it off quickly before he devastates your team with his power due to its high physical stats and its move
Hone Claws
which can raise its physical attack and accuracy by one level each. Avoid using a Grass-type move since it takes regular damage due to being part-
Steel-type
. Instead a
Fire
, Water, Ground, or
Fighting-type
attack should be capable of taking Excadrill down quickly enough.
Ride the first lift down from the entrance room and battle
Worker
Felix. Take the next lift down to the second level and go north; you can take this lift back up to battle Worker Sterling. Take the walkway along the rear and west walls to reach Worker Don, and take the next lift down to the third level. There are two other lifts on the third level; you can take the one to the right to battle
Clerk ♂
Isaac, then backtrack and ride the other up to the first level. Step out on the walkway to battle
Clerk ♀
Katie, then take the last lift down to the deepest part of the mine.

For defeating him,
Clay
awards you the
Quake Badge
. As your fifth Badge, the Quake Badge guarantees that all Pokémon up to level 60 will obey you. Unlike the other Gym Leaders, Clay won't give you a
TM
just yet. He will tell you to meet him at the end of
Route 6
.
Battle with Bianca
When you try to leave for
Route 6
,
Bianca
stops you. She's impressed that you just earned your fifth Badge, and after regaining her focus, challenges you to a battle.
