Pokémon Day Care
The
Pokémon Day Care
is run by an old couple that looks after Trainers' Pokémon while they are away. If you leave a Pokémon with them, you may return to find that it has leveled up. The old woman will only accept one Pokémon at a time, but return here after meeting her husband in
Nimbasa City
, and you'll be able to leave up to two Pokémon at once. If the two Pokémon are compatible, the old couple may discover an
Egg
!
Preschool
Battle the young Trainers here, then you'll need to fight a pair of
Twins
. This is the first
Double Battle
of the game, so make sure that your first and second Pokémon are up to the task. If your team is getting a little ragged, you can step inside the school building to have the teacher heal your team.
When you reach the fork in the road,
Cheren
shows up. He won the
Trio Badge
too and wants to see which of you is stronger.

The thieves give up the stolen Pokémon. Cheren leaves to return it, which gives you the chance to grab the
TM46
(
Thief
) sitting near the ledge. Return to Bianca, and the little girl gives you three
Heal Balls
as thanks.
The southern branch of the route is the first place that you'll find
dark grass
; the Pokémon that appear in these grass patches may appear in
Double Battles
. Cheren will give a brief explanation before moving on. Head south across the pond to reach Nacrene City.
Nacrene City
Nacrene City
Nacrene City
is a city of artists made up of restored century-old warehouses. It's also home to Café Warehouse, a stylish café for such a rural area. There's also a museum here where ancient Pokémon can be restored from
Fossils
.

When you enter the city, you find

waiting for you. He shows you to the Poké Center, and hands you a few
Chesto Berries
. He tells you about the local
Gym Leader
before heading off again.
Give your starter Pokémon an item
Speak to the woman in the second building west of the Pokémon Center. When she sees that you have a
Pokédex
, she'll ask which starter Pokémon you have. Depending on your answer, she will give you an item — a
Miracle Seed
, a
Charcoal
, or a
Mystic Water
— that will help power up your moves. Since another Miracle Seed can be found in
Pinwheel Forest
, it is better to answer "Tepig" or "Oshawott".
Loblolly's Studio
Loblolly's studio is in the southeast of the city near the entrance from Route 3. After visiting the
Dream World
at least once, she will begin designing pieces of décor that can be used in the Dream World. Up to five pieces can be unlocked the next time the Dream World is accessed.
Dye's house
Dye's house is the second building east of the Pokémon Center. On the first floor is a woman who will evaluate the
friendship
of your lead Pokémon. Dye is upstairs, and she's looking to
trade
. The Pokémon that she offers,
Petilil
B
or
Cottonee
W
, cannot be found in the wild.
The Café Warehouse
The Café Warehouse is a stylish café located in the northwest corner of town. If you speak to the waitress on a Wednesday, she will give you a free
Soda Pop
, which restores a Pokémon's health by 60 points.
Nacrene Gym
When you are about to enter the
Gym
,
N
steps outside. He talks a bit more about his vision of a perfect world, then challenges you to a battle.

When you defeat him, he walks off muttering about awakening some
legendary
dragon
. With him out of the way, you are free to challenge the Gym.
Nacrene City Pokémon Gym
Leader: Lenora
An Archeologist with Backbone
The
Nacrene Gym
, which specializes in
Normal-types
, is located in the back of the museum. The assistant director,
Hawes
, gives you a tour when you enter. He ends it by directing you to the Gym, which is managed by his wife
Lenora
. For an easier time, consider venturing west into
Pinwheel Forest
— you can catch a few
Fighting-types
here, and get
TM94
(
Rock Smash
) from a girl near the entrance.
The Gym doubles as a library, and features a scavenger hunt for Trainers to follow in order to reach Lenora. Start by reading through the book
Nice to Meet You, Pokémon!
on the front-left bookshelf. The memo inside explains her game, and starts off with the first question.

The Biology of

Behind School Kid Lydia, center-right bookcase
For the final question, speak to School Kid Lydia. Defeat her, then check the book behind her,
The Biology of Tepig
. The book triggers a switch on the shelf, moving the bookcase and revealing a staircase leading to the basement. The Gym Leader waits downstairs. A
Fighting-type
Pokémon like
Timburr
,
Throh
, or
Sawk
can be a big help, as Lenora's Pokémon are weak only to Fighting attacks.

For defeating her,
Lenora
gives you the
Basic Badge
, and
TM67
(
Retaliate
). Having a second Badge ensures that Pokémon up to level 30 will always obey you.
Hawes
rushes in, yelling that
Team Plasma
has invaded the museum. Follow them to the front of the museum to witness the villains running off with the
Dragon Skull
. Catch up to Lenora outside, and she'll introduce you to
Burgh
, the
Castelia City
Gym Leader.
Cheren
and
Bianca
show up to protect the museum, and Bianca gives you the
Dowsing MCHN
, a gift from
Fennel
that detects hidden items.
Head west with Burgh to search the forest.
