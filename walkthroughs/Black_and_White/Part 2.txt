Route 2
introduces a new Pokémon; the

As you enter
Route 2
, your
Xtransceiver
rings. It's Mom, checking in on you. She hangs up quickly though, and walks out of the
gate
from
Accumula Town
. She's got a gift for you—the
Running Shoes
! With these on, you can run around to your heart's content. She says goodbye and heads for home.
This route has three novice Trainers looking for a battle. The next city is home to the first Gym, so be sure to claim those experience points! You should aim to have your Pokémon around level 12 or 15 to be on par with the Gym Leader. Just as you are about to reach the safety of
Striaton City
,
Bianca
tracks you down for a second battle.

Striaton City
Striaton City
Striaton
is a small city that boasts such facilities as the Striaton Gym and the Trainer's School. The Gym can't be challenged until
Cilan
, one of the leaders, returns; coincidentally, he will return as soon as you defeat Cheren at the Trainer's School.
Fennel
's lab is housed inside the northeastern-most building; though Fennel will be too busy to see visitors until you get the Trio Badge. A small wood-like area is located east of the city.

The Dreamyard
The

is an old factory site just outside of the city limits. The plant is closed down, and the ruins are now a playground for Trainers. Battle the two Trainers, then speak to the second girl. After learning which
first partner Pokémon
you chose, she is willing to give you one of her own Pokémon to keep. The Pokémon that you receive will be one of the
elemental monkeys
, a trio of monkeys that share the first partners' type triangle of
Grass
,
Fire
, and
Water
. The type of monkey you receive will be able to cover your first partner Pokémon's weakness. This is especially helpful when challenging the Striaton Gym.

The students here are learning the basics of being a Pokémon Trainer, like status problems and

. The blackboard lists all the possible

that can affect a Pokémon. One student asks to quiz you, and answering the two questions correctly will earn you a
Full Heal
.
Cheren
is inside, studying the notes on the blackboard. He tells you that the Gym Leader just left for the Gym, and asks for a battle to practice using items.

Striaton Gym
The Striaton Gym
Striaton City Pokémon Gym
Leader: ---
Triple Trouble!
The
Striaton Gym
is designed as a restaurant, with tables and chairs in each of the four rooms. When you enter, the
Gym guide
, Clyde, gives you a
Fresh Water
to help against the Gym Leader. In this Gym, you progress by stepping on the switch whose type is effective against the type shown on each curtain.
When you speak to the green-haired guy in the back, two more appear out of nowhere—one with red hair, one with blue. These three brothers are the Striaton Gym Leaders;
Cilan
,
Chili
, and
Cress
. However, you'll only battle one of them to earn your first Badge; your opponent depends on which first partner Pokémon you chose. While your first Pokémon will be at a disadvantage, the monkey you received in the
Dreamyard
(either
Panpour
,
Pansage
, or
Pansear
) will be a definite help.

When the battle is over, your opponent will award you with the
Trio Badge
! He'll also give you
TM83
(
Work Up
) as a prize for defeating him. Work Up is a handy move that raises both
Attack
and
Special Attack
at once. Don't be afraid to use it — in
Generation V
, every
TM
can be used repeatedly without breaking. With one Badge, your Pokémon will obey you up to level 20, and you also earn the ability to use the move
Cut
outside of battle.
Fennel's Lab
When you leave the Gym, a woman approaches you and introduces herself as
Fennel
, a scientist who studies Pokémon Trainers. She leads you to her lab where she gives you
HM01
(
Cut
). Then she asks for a favor; she is looking for a bit of
Dream Mist
that a
Munna
gives off. You'll need to return to the
Dreamyard
to find it, but speak with her roommate first. She introduces herself as
Amanita
, the woman who designed
Unova
's PC system. She quickly explains the
Battle Box
, a feature that allows a Trainer to register a team of Pokémon that they battle alongside the most, allowing them to be quickly exchanged as a whole with the current party.
Back to Route 2 (optional)
Now that you have the HM for
Cut
, you have to option to return to Route 2 if you would like and collect some items.

Team Plasma Grunts
. The thugs are after the
Dream Mist
too, and plan to use it to manipulate people into releasing their Pokémon. They start to bully Munna, and attack you when you try to help it.

When you beat the grunts,
Ghetsis
shows up to scold them. The grunts remark that he is "not the Ghetsis who tries to manipulate people with his trick speeches", and they run off.
Musharna
lets its illusion disappear, and emerges from the shadows to comfort
Munna
. The two float away, leaving the Dream Mist behind.
Fennel
shows up right away and takes the mist back to her lab.
Collect the items here, and hunt for new Pokémon if you wish. Now that you have a Badge, you may occasionally discover
unusual activity
across the region, like rustling grass. This lets you encounter rarer species, like Musharna.
Audino
is the most common and gives a lot of experience upon defeat, making it a great way to train your Pokémon.
When you return to her lab, Fennel rewards you with the
C-Gear
. This device appears on the Touch Screen, and offers three means of communication: Wireless, Infrared, and Online. It lets you interact with other players, as well as access the
Entralink
and the
Dream World
. As thanks for helping Fennel,
Amanita
gives you the
Pal Pad
, which lets you interact with friends over Wi-Fi.
Now that all of that is done, you are free to head north to
Route 3
