Nuvema Town
When you walk downstairs from your room, you meet your mom's "twin". The mystery guest takes off the disguise and introduces himself by his code name,
Looker
, a member of the International Police. Thanks to you and the
Gym Leaders
,
Team Plasma
has fallen, but the
Seven Sages
are still at large. He asks you to help track them down, and gives you an item which has nothing to do with your search, the
Super Rod
, as thanks. Fish wherever you can to find not only stronger Pokémon, but also species foreign to the region.
Outside,
Bianca
and
Cheren
are waiting for you. Bianca apologizes for not alerting the Striaton Gym Leaders in time, and Cheren tells you that
Ghetsis
escaped from custody thanks to the
Shadow Triad
. He asks what everyone plans to do now, and Bianca says that she's headed to the settlement east of
Nimbasa City
. As the three of you discuss your plans,
Cedric Juniper
leaves the lab. He says that he just acquired new data from an acquaintance, and upgrades everyone's
Pokédex
with the National Mode! Everyone goes their separate ways, leaving you free to start hunting for the sages.
Route 18
To find the nearest sage,
surf
west from
Route 1
, and continue west to
Route 18
. Rood is on the beach on the island's southwest side, staring out to sea. He tells you about
N
and
Ghetsis
, then gives you
TM32
(
Double Team
).
Looker
then arrives to take him into custody.
The Dreamyard
The obstacles are now gone, so you can now enter the basement. Some of the Trainers underground will run when you approach them. Wait around the corner, and talk to them from the side to battle them. Fight your way to the southwest part of the basement to find a
TwistedSpoon
, then climb up the stairs in the southeast.
Pick up the
Revive
to the west, then go south to find the next of the sages. Gorm jumps out from behind the wall, and tells you about
Team Plasma
and
N's Castle
. He gives you
TM75
(
Swords Dance
) before
Looker
shows up to arrest him. Head west to find a
Hyper Potion
, move the boulder to create a shortcut, and go back down to the basement to grab
TM85
(
Dream Eater
) from the north corner. On Fridays only, a
Musharna
will appear in the eastern patch of grass. This is the only Musharna that can have the
Hidden Ability
Telepathy
, so make sure to catch it!

The Royal Unova
Trainers can board the
Royal Unova
in the evening. If you defeat a certain number of Trainers on board, you can get a prize. The challenge and prize change depend on the day of the week. Talk to the crew to get hints on where the Trainers are. You can climb the stairs to the deck to view the sun setting. Whistles blow several times, and eventually the ship will return to port. Beat the Trainers within the time limit to earn your reward!

After entering the castle itself, continue along until you reach B5F, the room where you and
Alder
confronted
Ghetsis
. The sand has piled up so that you can reach the door on the east side of the room. In the hallway beyond, a
Team Plasma Grunt
runs off when you get too close. Climb down the staircase to enter a maze of underground chambers, where the same Grunt attacks you. Go west to the opposite bi-level hallway, and scale the Relic Castle Tower to the top floor to get
TM26
(
Earthquake
). Climb back down the tower and travel southeast through the maze of chambers; you'll eventually meet Ryoku of the
Seven Sages
. He had been planning to catch the
Volcarona
in the next room for
Ghetsis
, but abandons his plan. He gives you
TM04
(
Calm Mind
), then
Looker
takes him into custody.
Volcarona
Go north from Ryoku's room to reach the deepest part of the
Relic Castle
. At the back of the room is
Volcarona
, a
Bug

Fire
-type. Volcarona can't be found in the wild, though you can evolve one from the
Larvesta
Egg you got on
Route 18
. Wear down its health with
Water
- and
Flying-type
attacks first, then chip away with
Bug
- or
Grass-type
moves. Watch out for its stat-raising
Quiver Dance
, and toss a few
Dusk Balls
to capture it.

You can now take the Battle Test at the

. The test assigns challengers a rank based on the results of battling five Trainers. Aim for a high rank by challenging it with your best-trained Pokémon.
Big Stadium and Small Court
During practice at the
Big Stadium and Small Court
, the Trainers here are looking to battle. Having completed the main story, there are not only more opponents to fight, but the levels of their Pokémon are a lot higher as well. Some will give you valuable items after you defeat them, like a
Max Revive
or
PP Max
. Visit every day to get lots of items!
