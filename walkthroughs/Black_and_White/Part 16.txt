Behind the two trees near Lass Fey is a

. On the bridge south of her is a girl with a
Wingull
, which needs help finding the three Grams it lost nearby.
Gram 2
is across the bridge south of here, along with a

; the southern-most Parasol Lady on the beach has
Gram 3
. Return the three Grams to Wingull to get

Surf north from the old man to find a

DeepSeaScale
in a patch of shallow water. To the west across the beach is a man in black; this
treasure hunter
will give you a valuable item once per day. Past him is a house with a move tutor, who will offer to teach your starter Pokémon either
Frenzy Plant

Blast Burn
, or
Hydro Cannon
. Northwest of that is a house with a Veteran who gives you the
Splash Plate
and
Draco Plate

Electirizer
lies behind a small tree to the southeast.

The
Giant Chasm
is the old impact site of a large meteor, with a verdant forest on the crater floor. The deepest part of the crater is said to be the home of a monster, and the residents of
Lacunosa
avoid the place at all costs. Many foreign Pokémon make their home here, like
Ditto
and
Absol
. A full list of available Pokémon can be found

Entrance Cave
Go left and check the first small rock to the west for a
Big Mushroom
, and move the boulder in the southwest to get a
Star Piece
. Inspect the small rocks in the northwest corner for a hidden
TinyMushroom
, then move the next boulder for a second Star Piece. Check the rocks just east of here for another TinyMushroom, and move the third boulder to find a
Comet Shard
. When you reach the northeast corner, you have a choice; you can either
surf
to the southwest, or jump the ledge and
shove
a fourth boulder. Both ways lead to the staircase at the exit.
Crater Forest
The trees and ledges in the crater forest form a natural maze, forcing travelers to move in a clockwise direction. Pick up the
Max Elixir
to your left and head north. Grab the
Max Potion
to the right and jump the ledge. A
Revive
lies in the northwest corner, and a
Carbos
is just south of it. To the east is a fork in the road with
TM13
(
Ice Beam
) on the southern trail. A
Full Heal
lies in a patch of dark grass, and a
Max Revive
is sitting among the trees in the southeast corner. To the northwest is
TM03
(
Psyshock
), in another patch of dark grass. Jump the ledge to the northwest, and follow the trail through the trees to the pit in the middle of the forest. Something cries out when you approach it, and the whole forest is instantly buried under a thick blanket of snow. Go northeast to enter the monster's lair.
The Monster's Lair
Inside this tiny cave is
Kyurem
, the third member of the
Tao trio
. Start off by inflicting double-damage with
Fighting
-,
Rock
-, or
Dragon-type
attacks, then wear down its health with
Grass
-,
Water
-, or
Electric-type
moves. Its signature move
Glaciate
, while not overly powerful, is guaranteed to reduce the target's Speed, and
Endeavor
can be brutal as its health is worn away. As the battle takes place in a cave, Dusk Balls are an effective method of capture.

With

captured, the snow that had buried the forest is gone, so you can collect any items you may have missed. Now make your way south to
