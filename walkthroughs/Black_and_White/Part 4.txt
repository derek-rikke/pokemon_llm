Pinwheel Forest
Exterior
West of
Nacrene City
is a short road that leads into
Pinwheel Forest
. If you have not already done so, speak to the girl just outside the city to get
TM94
(
Rock Smash
). South of the entrance is a puddled area with a handful of
young
Trainers
. On the top of the cliff to the southeast sits a challenge rock. A
Fighting-type
in your party can hit the rock once a day, and each hit chips off a
Star Piece
that can be sold for a high price.

Interior
The forest itself is crawling with
Grass
- and
Bug-types
, so be wary of status problems. If you need to rest your team, you can speak with the
Nurse
outside rather than run back to
Nacrene
.
Burgh
will block the northern exit while you trek through the underbrush to chase down
Team Plasma
. The fourth and final
Team Plasma Grunt
will give up the
Dragon Skull
when you defeat him.
Gorm
, one of the team's
Seven Sages
, arrives and prepares to attack you, but is blocked by
Burgh
and
Lenora
. Faced with two
Gym Leaders
, the thugs flee the forest. Lenora takes back the Dragon Skull you retrieved and rewards you with a
Moon Stone
. Follow her to the east to find the road, and head north to reach the exit, or you can stay behind and try to catch some new Pokémon.
Pidove
and
Pansear
will be useful in your upcoming Gym Battle.

Get an evolution stone
Pass through the
gate
and walk out onto the pier nearby. The scientist here will tell you that the
elemental monkey
you received in the
Dreamyard
evolves when exposed to the appropriate stone. He will give you one of three stones depending on the species, either a
Leaf Stone
,
Fire Stone
, or
Water Stone
. It's advisable not to choose the Fire Stone even if your
elemental monkey
is
Pansear
, because the stones are useful for evolving other Pokémon as well, and another Fire Stone can be found in the Desert Resort later on. Instead, choose one of the other two, which are harder to locate.
Register a rare Pokémon
In the lobby of the
Game Freak
building on Castelia Street, a girl is reading a picture book to a small boy. "
Zorua
, who was left alone, wandered around looking for
its mother
..." Listening to the story will register Zorua in your Pokédex.
Raise a Pokémon's happiness
In the building across the street from
Game Freak
's office, a woman will offer to give one of your Pokémon a massage, which will make it more

The Royal Unova
The cruise ship, the

Studio Castelia
In the studio on Mode Street is a
Harlequin
that will ask to see a certain type of Pokémon every day. If you show him a Pokémon that is at least partially the correct type, he will give one
Berry
of your choice;
Cheri Berry
,

It's not easy to buy

Casteliacone
can heal all of a Pokémon's status problems.
Get a new TM
There isn't much happening on Narrow Street. As you pass by the blue dumpsters, a man in sunglasses jumps out from behind them and gives you
TM70

Round up the three Dancers
Dancer
Mickey is near the city fountain. He tells you that he wants to form a dance team, and asks you to convince the two other dancers; Edmond on Narrow Street, and Raymond on Unity Pier. Defeat each one to gather them at the fountain, and Mickey will give you an

Meet Cheren and Burgh at the Gym
When you try to enter the Gym on the westernmost street,
Cheren
emerges, having just earned his next Badge.
Burgh
is right behind him, and asks you to follow him to Prime Pier. It seems that
Team Plasma
has shown up again.
When you reach the pier, you meet up with
Burgh
,
Bianca
, and a girl named
Iris
. It appears that Bianca's
Munna
was stolen by
Team Plasma
. One of the thugs returns while the group is talking, and runs as soon as she sees Burgh, who chases after her. Follow him to the building across the street from the Gym, and help Burgh take out the trio outside.

Ghetsis
tells a legend about the founding of the

region, revealing a bit more about his plans. Ghetsis lectures Burgh at first, but backs down and returns Bianca's
Munna
. The Plasma group flees,leaving behind a
Smoke Ball

Iris
gives you a

Castelia Gym
Castelia Gym
Castelia City Pokémon Gym
Leader: Burgh
"Premier Insect Artist"
The
Castelia Gym
specializes with
Bug-type
Pokémon, and the building itself is designed like a giant beehive. In order to reach
Burgh
, you need to disengage the six gates by stepping on certain switches. Each gate will drop when both its posts are lit up. Two of the four
Harlequins
in the Gym are hiding under the floor, so they spring up when you try to step on their switches.
Burgh
's
Whirlipede
and
Leavanny
are weak to
Fire
- and
Flying-type
attacks, while his
Dwebble
is vulnerable to
Water
- and
Rock-type
moves. If you can't exploit these weaknesses, an alternative tactic is to use
TM70
(
Flash
) to lower his Pokémon's accuracy. But, his Pokémon know some weak moves. Useful Pokémon are
Roggenrola
with
Rock Blast
or a
Tympole
with
Mud Shot
, because they can both deal with Burgh's Whirlipede and Dwebble pretty easily. Leavanny can be taken out by using
Timburr
's
Rock Throw
, as it will resist Leavanny's
Struggle Bug
. If you started with
Tepig
or obtained a
Pansear
, Leavanny can be easily dealt with, and
Pidove
can be extremely useful.
