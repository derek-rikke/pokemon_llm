When you defeat
Cheren
,
Alder
jumps down from the cliff. He was watching the battle, and tells Cheren that what he does with the power gained by becoming stronger is important. Alder gives you each a copy of
HM03
(
Surf
), then leaves to the south. Cheren climbs the staircase and enters Twist Mountain.
Now that you have the ability to cross bodies of water, you can backtrack to a few locations that were previously unreachable.
Now that you have Surf (optional)
Now that you have access to the HM for Surf, you can get some items in places previously visited, and even go to some new ones.

Cobalion
,
Terrakion
, and
Virizion
.
The old man's story
In the distant past, when Pokémon and people lived in different worlds, a war between people started an intense fire in a forest where many Pokémon lived. The Pokémon were surrounded by smoke and flames. They were in big trouble. And then, the legends
Cobalion
,
Terrakion
, and
Virizion
appeared! Terrakion used its amazing strength to destroy rocks blocking the escape route. Virizion used its quick movements to protect Pokémon from looming flames. And Cobalion led the frightened Pokémon out of the burning woods. ... The people who started the war were routed by the power of the legends. Because of Cobalion, Terrakion, and Virizion, the war was ended. ... When people fight, there's no peace for Pokémon, either. The three legends learned that the deeds of humans could lead to dire consequences for their world. ... They cut themselves off from people and disappeared. No one saw much of them after that, and the three faded into myth...
Pick up a
Rare Candy
to the northwest, then go south and drop the final two boulders into position. Head northwest to find
Cobalion
.
Cobalion
Cobalion
's
Ability
,
Justified
, gives it an
Attack
boost whenever it is hit by a
Dark-type
attack. When this happens, its
Sacred Sword
attack becomes very powerful, so be careful. Lower its health with
Normal
-,
Grass
-, and
Ice-type
moves before attempting to capture it. If you need to use TM's, it would be recommended to teach a Pokémon
Reflect
since it can reduce the damage from Cobalion's attacks by half.

The old man approaches you after the battle, and says that because
Cobalion
is starting to trust you,
Terrakion
and
Virizion
will give you a chance to battle them, as well. Terrakion is hidden deep in
Victory Road
, out of reach for now. Virizion, however, is waiting in Rumination Field, on the eastern side of
Pinwheel Forest
.
Pinwheel Forest
Regardless of the way you entered, look for a hole in the fence northeast of the bridges. Trek east through the dark grass and go to the far southeast edge of the forest to find
TM22
(
SolarBeam
). Go west to reach the small pond, and check for a
Rare Candy
on the southeast side.
Surf
west across the water to grab the
SilverPowder
from the ledge, then sail back across the pond and head northeast. Walk through the fallen log and pick up the
Hyper Potion
from the tree stump. Rumination Field lies to the north.

Rumination Field
Rumination Field is a tiny, isolated part of the forest, with no other point of interest but
Virizion
itself. Like
Cobalion
, its
Justified
Ability
boosts its
Attack
when it takes damage from a
Dark-type
move. Weaken it with super-effective moves (excluding
Flying-type
moves due to Virizion suffering a 4× weakness due to its type combo), then whittle its health down with
Water
-,
Grass
-, or
Ground-type
attacks.
