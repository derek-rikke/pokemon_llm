Twist Mountain
Twist Mountain
is a mountain rich in valuable minerals, and the multitude of tunnels make it easy for
Workers
to extract them from the surrounding rock. The tunnels are spread out over four floors, but you cannot explore the entire area on your first visit. The mountain is prone to heavy snow in the
winter
months, blocking some tunnels and revealing others.

Near the entrance, you run into
Clay
, who is checking up on the mines. He is concerned because he hasn't seen
Team Plasma
lately, and doesn't know the location of their base. He leaves, and
Cheren
heads deeper into the mountain.
The interior of the mountain is a deep pit, with many walkways lining the walls. Go north from the entry tunnel to find a
Revive
, then southeast for a
Full Heal
. Take the southern doorway, fight
Hiker
Darrell, make a left down the first path and go through the doorway to fight
Ace Trainer
Caroll. Then go back in the tunnel and go through the doorway behind
Battle Girl
Sharon. Take the next doorway to an area covered with piles of dirt (one of which hides
Worker
Heath). Pick up a hidden
Stardust
on the second pile of dirt, and a
Moon Stone
to the east. Climb down the staircase to reach the mountain's mid-level.
2F
To the south are a half-dozen more piles of dirt; one hides a
Stardust
while another hides
Worker
Rob. Take the western doorway, and go north to find a

. Follow the walkway to the west for an
Ether
and the next doorway. Walk all the way to the west to find a hidden
Elixir
, then go northwest to find
Worker
Cairn and a
PP Up
. Jump the ledge for the
Nugget
and the hidden
Revive
behind it, and loop around to the northeast doorway. To the south is

1F
Go west to find an
Ultra Ball
, then head south past
Black Belt
Teppei and (the hidden)
Worker
Rich to reach the interior floor.
Outside is an empty rest house, a conveniently placed vending machine, and two bulldozers. Head south and enter the lowest area. Climb down the staircase to the deepest part of the mountain. The damp cave houses a large
ice-covered rock
, and
TM91
(
Flash Cannon
) to the northeast. Climb back up to the central area, and step through the northeast doorway.
Soon you find
Cheren
arguing with a
Plasma
grunt. Then a second enters, and tells the first that "that item" has been found, and they should go to the tower. They disappear in a flash, leaving you to take the exit to

On the first floor, you can hear something on a rampage further up the tower. The second floor is littered with broken columns; these act as a bridge if you don't have a Pokémon with
Strength
. Don't miss the
Hyper Potion
and the
Stardust
.

The third floor is covered with one-way launch ramps. Jump to the south, then take the middle ramp west, then north to reach a
Shiny Stone
. Go south and take the southernmost ramp west to the winding staircase.
4F
When you reach the fourth floor,
Brycen
and
Cheren
are holding off a large group of
Team Plasma
members. Brycen tells you to go on ahead while they keep the criminals busy. Head to the next floor and put a hurting on the five Plasma grunts that try to stop you. Grab the Dragon Fang in the northeast corner, and take the exit to the north.
5F
The fifth floor is made up of four large circular paths around the central column. Head to the right to find a
Star Piece
, then a
Stardust
. Walk around the column and jump the ramp to reach a
Revive
, then go left to reach the stairs.
6F
When you reach the sixth floor, you hear more of the rampage above. Giallo of the
Seven Sages
is standing here, speaking to four of the grunts. He commands them to attack, and you have to defeat all four in a row before you can advance.
7F
On the top floor,
N
is befriending the legendary Pokémon
Zekrom
B
/
Reshiram
W
. The dragon recognizes N as a hero. N tells you that if you want to stop him, you must become a hero as well. He tells you to look for the other dragon, and flies off with his new ally.
When you return to the entrance,
Alder
arrives. He tells you that the
Relic Castle
may hold a clue about the other legendary dragon.
