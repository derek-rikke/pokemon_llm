Ghetsis gives another speech
When you first enter the city,
Alder
beckons you to a crowd gathered by the Trainer Tips sign.
Ghetsis
tells the people that
N
has joined forces with the legendary dragon, and is going to create a new world. He tries to persuade them to release their Pokémon, then he and his entourage leave. His speech puts the city's residents into turmoil.
After
Team Plasma
leaves, two of the residents are still upset by Ghetsis' speech. Alder introduces them as
Drayden
and
Iris
, the two
Dragon-type
specialists that hold a clue regarding the legendary dragon. The two invite you to Drayden's house to talk things over.
Get Props from the old man
In the westernmost house is an old man who is a big fan of
Nimbasa City
's Pokémon Musical. Talk to him to get a new Prop once per day. Visit him on four different days to get each Prop.
The Battle House
The Battle House is located two doors east of the Gym. Inside, the two
Ace Trainers
will battle you according to the new format. The man near the entrance will teach you the detailed rules. Unlike most Trainers, these Ace Trainers can be rebattled every day.

Legend of the Twin Dragons
Inside
Drayden
's house, he and
Iris
tell the story of the legendary dragons. According to them,
Reshiram
and
Zekrom
were once the same Pokémon. That single dragon, along with twin heroes, brought the
Unova
region into being. Things were peaceful, for a time. One day, the older brother who sought truth, and the younger brother who sought ideals, began to argue about who was right. The dragon split its body into two, one siding with each brother. The white dragon pursued truth, while the black dragon sought ideals. Their battle raged endlessly, and because they were once the same entity, their powers were matched. Neither emerged as a clear winner, they simply exhausted themselves. The brothers realized that neither side was right and stopped fighting. But their sons started the feud again, and an instant later, Reshiram and Zekrom destroyed Unova with fire and lightning.
Unfortunately, neither Drayden or Iris know how to awaken the second dragon from the stone. But since you're in town, Drayden
B
/ Iris
W
returns to the Gym to await your challenge.

Leader: Drayden
The Spartan Mayor
Opelucid City Pokémon Gym
Leader: Iris
The Girl Who Knows the Hearts of Dragons
As
Drayden
and
Iris
are both
Dragon-type
specialists, you can expect the same from the eight Gym Trainers. The
Opelucid Gym
is designed around three dragon statues. Each statue moves its head and neck when the appropriate switch is stepped on. Challengers will need to make multiple passes around the Gym in order to reach the Gym Leader. The dragons here are all vulnerable to
Ice
- and
Dragon-type
attacks; if you are lacking these moves, use a TM to teach
Frost Breath
or
Blizzard
. Look out for
Dragon Dance
— it raises the user's
Attack
and
Speed
, so defeat the opponent quickly to avoid taking major damage!
Fight
Ace Trainer
Webster and climb onto the eastern statue. Jump the ramp, battle Ace Trainer Olwen, and drop down onto the statue's right hand; the switch here raises the arm, and moves the dragon's head to the left. Go north over the dragon's face, fight Ace Trainer Jose, and step the statue's left hand; this raises its head, letting you reach the level above. Take the walkway southwest to reach the center statue, drop down onto the switch (which turns its head north, creating a dead-end), and go south to fight
Veteran
Hugo. Circle around to hit next switch, which raises the dragon's head to the east. Follow the walkway down the staircase and fight Ace Trainer Tom. Head southwest to reach the third statue, and circle around clockwise to undo the dead-end. Climb up its neck and battle Ace Trainer Dara by the west wall, and drop on the final switch. Climb up the dragon to reach the south wall, and head east. Go northwest from Veteran Kim to climb the middle dragon's back to
Drayden

When you emerge victorious from your final Gym battle, Drayden / Iris awards you your final Badge! The
Legend Badge
makes all Pokémon obey you, regardless of their level. The Gym Leader also rewards your victory with
TM82
(
Dragon Tail
).
Meet up with Professor Juniper
When you leave the Gym,
Professor Juniper
is waiting for you. Seeing your eighth Badge, she leads you to the city's north gate, which leads to
Route 10
. She is so impressed with your progress, and thankful for your help, she gives you a
Master Ball
as a gift.
When you enter the gate, the guide tells you about a large storm on Route 7. When you pass by the house in the route's center, the old woman lets you inside. Listen to her story, then leave. When you do, the trouble-making Pokémon shows itself in the midst of the downpour. It quickly flies off, taking the storm with it. From this point on,
Tornadus
B
or
Thundurus
W
will roam the region, appearing at level 40. It roams the region's southern routes in the mornings, and the northern routes in the evenings; check the various bulletin boards in every gate to track its location.
Head north from
Opelucid City
.
Route 10
Route 10
Route 10
is surrounded by tall trees and a winding river. Many strong Trainers here are looking to battle, eager to prepare themselves for the trials ahead. The east end of the route leads to the Badge Check Gates, and
Victory Road
.

Once the battle is over,
Cheren
heals your Pokémon and
Bianca
gives you three
Max Revives
to help with the battles ahead. Cheren runs off to train some more, and Bianca leaves you with a few words of encouragement. Go north through the dark grass to pick up a
Hyper Potion
and a
Dawn Stone
, go south over the bridge, and talk to the man by the trees to get a
Dusk Stone
. Get
TM05
(
Roar
) from the ledge, and go east over the bridge.
Badge Check Gates
The Badge Check Gates are the final man-made obstacle standing between you and the Pokémon League. Each Badge opens a different gate, and the rooms between are designed in a style reminiscent of each Gym. Show your Badges to the eight guards, and Victory Road stands tall before you.
Victory Road
Victory Road
Victory Road
is the final trial before the Pokémon League. Carved into a steep cliffside dotted with caves, you'll need to go back and forth through this network of tunnels to collect all the items. Some of the strongest Trainers in
Unova
are doing some last-minute training, so don't expect an easy climb. Stock up on Ultra Balls before you begin, as another legendary Pokémon makes its home near the top floor. Pokémon in your party with the moves Surf and Strength will be convenient.

As you enter the cave you have the option to
Surf
north west from the entrance to find a
Max Revive
. You may also climb the stairs to the second floor on the east wall of the cave.
2F
Fight Ace Trainer Shanta before re-emerging on the cliffside. Two people are discussing sliding down the cliff. Slide down and follow him through the broken fence to find yourself on the eastern side of ground level.
1F (east)
Make sure to stay to the right and not to jump all the way back to the beginning cave! Walk all the way east until you find the very next cave entrance. Here you will find a pool of water, convenient to surf over, or walk around it to reach the stairs. You may Surf across the northern patch of water to reach a
Rare Candy
. Either way climb the stairs.
2F (east)
Look for the hidden
Ultra Ball
on the upper level, and climb the stairs to the north.
3F (east, center)
Beat up Ace Trainer Dwayne, then walk outside and go west. Sliding down here will make you start over a level.
If you'd like to get to the Elite Four quickly, skipping two trainers and a couple items, including
TM12
(
Taunt
), go through the last entrance to the far left. Jump ahead to section 3F (west) of the walkthrough.
Otherwise, take the middle entrance. Look for a hidden
Hyper Potion
before battling Veteran Tiffany. There are two stairways to the east; go down the southern one and
shove
the boulder into place to create a shortcut back here.
After making the shortcut, head back up to the second floor and exit back onto the ledge. Head all the way right, and slide down to pick up
TM12
(
Taunt
).
Next, take advantage of the shortcut you just opened by sliding down and returning to the starting door of floor 1. Take the stairs to the second floor, and use the shortcut to return to 3F (Center).
Again, you could head outside and take the left entrance for a quicker trip to the Elite Four (jump to 3F (west)), or take the stairs up to the fourth floor.
4F (center)
Fight Ace Trainer Cathy, grab the
Full Restore
from the outer ledge, and go downstairs and outside. Proceed through the left-most cave entrance.
3F (west)
Battle Black Belt Tyrone, and climb the stairs.
4F (west)
Defeat Doctor Logan to have him heal your Pokémon. Walk around the upper level to the north, drop the boulder for another shortcut, grab the hidden
Revive
from the rock, and climb upstairs to 5F.
5F
You may go back out onto the cliffside. Drop through either break in the fence, grab the
Calcium
inside near Doctor Logan, then go back outside and head west. Cross the bridge and drop down the two levels to the first floor to get an
Ultra Ball
. Use the two shortcuts to make your way back up the mountain to the sixth floor.
Or skip the Calcium and head straight up the stairs.
6F
Battle Ace Trainer David by the stairs, and take the western exit to get a
Full Heal
. Go back inside and take the other exit, then drop through the eastern break in the fence.
4F (east)
Go north and battle Veteran Martell. Look for a
Full Heal
hidden on the wall, and go north to find a
Carbos
hidden across from the stairs. Climb up to 7F.
7F
Head west and go back downstairs to the sixth floor.
6F
Move the boulder into place, then go west. This part of the cave is known as the Trial Chamber.
Trial Chamber
Inside is
Terrakion
if you've completed Mistralton Cave, the third member of the
Swords of Justice
. Like the others, its
Justified
ability boosts its
Attack
when hit by a
Dark-type
attack, making its
Sacred Sword
move much more powerful. Wear it down with
Normal
-,
Fire
-, or
Bug-type
moves before trying to catch it.

Go east and climb back up to 7F, then exit to the south. You've reached the end of
Victory Road
, though there are still a few items to track down. You may want to go north to visit the Pokémon League first, so you can simply
fly
there later.
Mountaintop
Stand on the west side of the Pokémon Ranger, drop down two levels, and cross the bridge to find
TM93
(
Wild Charge
). Fly to the top of the mountain and stand on the Ranger's right side. Slide down the cliff-face to the ground floor to get a
Nugget
, and enter the west side of 1F. Climb midway up the cave and go east to find a hidden
Max Potion
and a hidden
Max Revive
. Take the stairs to 3F, where you'll find
TM02
(
Dragon Claw
). Jump the ledge, exit to the south, and fly up to the Pokémon League.
