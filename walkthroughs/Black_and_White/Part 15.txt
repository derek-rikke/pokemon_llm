The Champion, Alder
Alder
Upon reaching the Champion's temple,
Alder
thanks you for defeating
N
and quickly accepts your challenge. His Pokémon have a variety of types, though some of them share weaknesses. His
Accelgor
,
Escavalier
, and
Vanilluxe
are all vulnerable to
Fire-type
attacks. Accelgor and
Volcarona
are weak against
Flying-type
moves, while Vanilluxe and
Bouffalant
both take double-damage from
Fighting-type
moves. They all attack with powerful moves, so taking too much time is dangerous. Strike their weak points to defeat them quickly.
