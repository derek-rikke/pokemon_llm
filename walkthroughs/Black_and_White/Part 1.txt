Starting Out
(Japanese screenshot) Professor Juniper and her Minccino customarily introduce you to the world of Pokémon
After selecting
New Game
you are asked to choose your character's gender. This cannot be changed after selecting. The resident researcher of the
Unova
region,
Professor Juniper
, appears and introduces new Trainers to the Pokémon world. Her lecture is important for new players, though it's nothing new to veterans of the series. She also introduces the player's best friends, who are also their rivals,
Cheren
and
Bianca
. Once she is done talking, you are asked to enter your character's name. Your name cannot be changed, so double-check that you have typed it correctly. Press
OK
and you are ready for your adventure!
Nuvema Town
Nuvema Town
You find yourself with the cool-headed
Cheren
in your bedroom, waiting for
Bianca
to show up.
Juniper
believes that the three of you have potential as Pokémon trainers, and has delivered a purple gift box containing three rare
first partner Pokémon
to begin each of your journeys. The two Pokémon you don't pick cannot be legitimately obtained without trading, so choose carefully. An excited Bianca arrives shortly, and the two urge you to take first pick of the Pokémon, as the box was delivered to your house.

The
Grass-type
Snivy
has the most weaknesses out of the three first partners, with five-
Fire
-,
Bug
-,
Poison
-,
Flying
-, and
Ice-types
(although it and its evolutions make up for this with their superior
Defense
and
Sp. Def
). Its Grass attacks are strong against
Rock
-,
Ground
-, and
Water-types
.
The
Fire-type
Tepig
is great when battling
Grass
-,
Bug
-.
Ice
- and
Steel-types
, but has trouble when facing
Water
-,
Ground
-, and
Rock-types
. Tepig is unique amongst the Unova first partners due to it gaining a secondary type as it grows, while Snivy and Oshawott do not. The type,
Fighting
, adds two weaknesses in
Psychic
and
Flying
, but eliminates the Rock-type weakness. With their ability to learn Fighting moves (albeit
only
two
naturally) as well as Fire attacks, Tepig's evolutions have the most type advantages of the first partner evolutions, with the added edge against
Normal
-
Dark
- and
Rock-type
Pokémon.
The
Water-type
Oshawott
's Water attacks have an advantage when facing
Fire
-,
Rock
-, and
Ground-types
, but may struggle with
Grass
- and
Electric-types
. With only two disadvantages even in its final form, Oshawott is arguably the safest choice of the three first partners.
After you choose your first Pokémon,
Bianca
takes the one with a type disadvantage to yours, leaving the last with a type advantage to yours for
Cheren
. Bianca then suggests a battle.
Cheren
opts out, so she decides to battle you. When the battle is over, Cheren heals both Pokémon, regardless of the outcome. Bianca apologizes for the Pokémon destroying your room, then persuades Cheren to battle you.
Unlike the rest of the Trainers in the game, losing to either Bianca or Cheren will not result in a
black out
; the story will progress as usual regardless of the outcome of each battle.

The Journey Begins
Your friends will then leave the room to apologize to your Mom for the mess. Your Mom then asks not to worry and should continue on your journey. Seeing that you are about to set out on a long adventure, she gives you a gift — the
Xtransceiver
! This gadget allows video calls with up to four people at once, a handy way for Mom and
Professor Juniper
to contact you and your friends.
The three of you decide to stop by the Juniper Lab to thank the professor for her gift.
Bianca
rushes off to tell her family of her impending adventure, and
Cheren
leaves for the lab. He waits outside for the two of you, but you'll need to stop by Bianca's house to pick her up. When you step inside, her dad is angry, and dead-set against her leaving. He cools off a little and she leaves for the lab.
When you all arrive,
Juniper
asks if you three would mind helping with her studies, researching the origins of Pokémon. She hands each of you a
Pokédex
, and gives you a chance to name your new Pokémon before sending you on your way. Mom is waiting outside the lab, and hands each of you a
Town Map
to start off your journey.

Route 1
As you leave your hometown behind, you find
Bianca
and
Cheren
waiting for you. At Bianca's request, the three of you all take your first step onto
Route 1
together.
Professor Juniper
is waiting here, and demonstrates how to catch a wild
Patrat
with her
Minccino
. After the tutorial, she gives you 5
Poké Balls
to start you off, and heads north to
Accumula Town
. Bianca then suggests a Pokémon hunt; whoever has the most in their party before reaching Accumula Town wins. As you walk north, Juniper calls the three of you on the
Xtransceiver
asking to meet her at the nearest Pokémon Center. To win the challenge, you must catch two (three including the Pokémon you received at the start) Pokémon, but it's not necessary to continue and you don't receive any reward for winning.

Route 1
has two Normal-types, Patrat and Lillipup. Strengthwise, the Lillipup line is stronger than Patrat's; however, to win, it's advisable to capture both of them.

As you enter
Accumula Town
, you find the professor waiting in front of the
Pokémon Center
. Speak to her to learn about all of the services available inside. Unlike past games, these now include the
Poké Mart
and
GTS
. Before she leaves, the professor asks you to visit
Fennel
, a friend of hers in the next city. Heal up your team and be sure to buy a few
Potions
and
Poké Balls
for the road ahead.
Outside,
Cheren
directs your attention to a crowd of people gathered in the plaza. The soundtrack changes to some creepy music, and you see a line of people dressed in what looks like medieval armor standing behind the speaker, who introduces himself as
Ghetsis
. He gives a radical speech on behalf of
Team Plasma
that advocates the liberation of Pokémon from people. The speech ends, and the group leaves. As you and Cheren discuss the event, a teenage boy with green hair approaches you, claiming that he can hear your Pokémon "speaking." He introduces himself as
N
, and demands a battle, which you must win in order to proceed.
