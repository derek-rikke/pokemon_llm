Black City and White Forest
The southeast locale on
Unova
's main landmass differs between versions, either
Black City
or
White Forest
, respectively.
Black City
Black City is a sprawling metropolis of perpetual development. The number of people living here, and the progress of development, depends on the number of days it took you to get here after first starting the game. The number of buildings depends on the number of residents, which can be anywhere from zero to ten. As the city develops, you can battle many different Trainers.
If you don't talk to the people here for too long, they will disappear. Once that happens, you'll need to use the
Entralink
to visit another player's White Forest to bring people over to replace the residents that left. You can't invite people if you already have ten in the city, or if there is another person here with the same name.
Market
The market is the large building west of the Pokémon Center. The building has five counters, and the number of shopkeepers increases along with the city's development. The items are all expensive, but sometimes valuable evolution-related items are offered. The items in the market change depending on the residents in the city.
Talk to the boss after defeating ten of the residents outside. He will reward you with
$
10,000! He will pay you for each group of ten Trainers you defeat, though there is a limit to the number of people. A full list of Trainers can be found
here
.
Two of the people inside are Trainers, and will challenge you to Rotation battles.

Route 15
.
White Forest
White Forest
is a healthy woodland. As more residents visit the area, the forest grows. When people leave, the trees wither and the ponds dry up. Like Black City, the growth of the forest depends on the number of days it took you to get here after first starting the game. If you don't talk to the people here for too long, they will disappear. Once that happens, you'll need to use the
Entralink
to visit another player's
Black City
to bring people over to replace the residents that left. You can't invite people if you already have ten in the forest, or if there is another person here with the same name.
Where Black City attracts people, the forest attracts Pokémon. None of them are native species, and they are all found at level 5. The Pokémon that appear depend on which residents are living here. All species are common, and can't be avoided by using a
Repel
.

Go south from the gate and move the boulder at the foot of the stairs to get an

. Move the other boulder into place and climb the stairs to find
TM09
(
Venoshock
). Work your way to the west side of the cliff to find a trailer parked here; the woman inside is offering to trade her
Rotom
for a
Ditto
. Take Rotom to
Shopping Mall Nine
's warehouse to change its forms. Check out the Transfer Lab before reaching
Marvelous Bridge
.
The Poké Transfer Lab
Poké Transfer Lab
The
Poké Transfer Lab
is the building that houses the
Poké Transfer
itself, the machinery that can transfer Pokémon from a
Generation IV
game. When you first enter, a Scientist leads you to Professor Andrew Park, who is very excited to see that you have all eight badges. After his rambling speech, you can participate at any time. The minigame itself involves two DS systems, or a DS and a 3DS system, a Poké Ball-flinging crossbow, and a few clouds of pink sleeping gas. Pokémon that are transferred from Sinnoh or Johto cannot be returned. They also are not allowed to have any items, or know any HM moves.
Marvelous Bridge
Marvelous Bridge
Marvelous Bridge
is a beautiful futuristic bridge that stretches over the ocean between
Route 15
and
Route 16
. Like
Driftveil Drawbridge
, flying Pokémon sometimes drop their
feathers
on the bridge. Continue west to reach Route 16.
New Style of Battle
In the eastern gate of the bridge, there is an Ace Trainer that will challenge you daily. She will challenge you to either a
Triple Battle
B
or
Rotation Battle
W
; this is the only Trainer in the entire game that will challenge you to that kind of battle.

The Vanishing Girl
Sometimes a girl is standing next to the man on the bridge's east end. When you approach, she disappears. The old woman at the foot of the elevator tells you that there used to be a girl who lived around here who always played with
Abra
, before the bridge was built...
The Famous Patrat Show
Having spoken to the woman on
Village Bridge
, you can now watch the famous
Patrat
Show here. She gives one of the rodents a
Big Mushroom
, and if you can guess which one has it, she lets you keep it. She puts on the show every day.
The Shadows Reappear
As you near the west end of the bridge, the
Shadow Triad
suddenly appears. After they saved him from capture at
N's Castle
,
Ghetsis
went off somewhere alone. He had apparently saved their lives once, and they had sworn loyalty to him. Complying with his wishes, they refuse to search for him. He had one last request for them, and the three give you the
Adamant
,
Lustrous
, and
Griseous Orbs
. They don't know how or why he had these items, but they say he wanted you to have them. Their task complete, the trio disappears one last time.
The Magikarp Salesman
On the bridge's west end is
a man
who will sell you a
Magikarp
for
$
500. Unlike previous Pokémon games, the fish is foreign to the region, so you won't find it normally. After enough training it grows into the formidable
Gyarados
. If you decide to take him up on his offer, return here with an empty slot in your party.
Route 16
Route 16
Route 16
is a short road that links
Marvelous Bridge
to
Nimbasa City
. A break in the trees on the north side leads to
Lostlorn Forest
. People seem to always get lost there, even though the forest is fairly small.

The Mysterious Woman
On the north side of the forest, a Backpacker talks to you about the
odd woman
inside the trailer. He enjoys traveling the world, but in stark contrast, the woman seems to think that living quietly by herself is important. Even if you speak to her, the woman won't say a word. Maybe she would
respond
to a
certain Pokémon
in your party...
Having finally traveled everywhere in
Unova
, it's time to get cracking on that Pokédex.
Black and White
introduced 156 new Pokémon, bringing the grand total to a whopping 649, so you've got your work cut out for you!
