When you first arrive at
Solaceon Town
, you'll have a quick encounter with
Barry
who will mention
Seals
and the
Solaceon Ruins
. A man on the left side of the path north to
Route 210
will give you the
Pokétch
app
Pokémon History
.
Pokémon Day Care
If you travel east along the northern border of Solaceon Town, you will see three sets of ledges to jump down. Take the middle one, then jump down the next two and you will arrive at the house of the seal woman who will give you the
Seal Case
, and her son, who will hand over an alphabet Seal for each corresponding
Unown
you show him (including ? and !).
Day Care
Most notably in
Solaceon Town
is the
Pokémon Day Care
in the northwest corner of the town. You can deposit up to two Pokémon that you want to be trained by talking to the Day-Care Lady. It will cost
$
100 as a starting fee and
$
100 more for each level the Pokémon gains. The Pokémon deposited gain one
exp. point
per step you walk, however they won't grow to be as strong as Pokémon raised to an equivalent level solely through battling. When you deposit a Pokémon into the Day Care for the first time, a man will appear at the table inside. When spoken to, he will give you the
Pokétch
app
Day Care Checker
. This is where you can
breed
Pokémon by depositing two of the same
Egg Group
.
Pokémon News Press
Next to the
Pokémon Center
is the
Pokémon News Press
. One of the men inside asks the player each day to show him a different Pokémon the player has already seen or caught (because of this the Pokémon he wants to see is often simple to obtain), awarding Poké Balls if the request is granted. A player who accomplishes this task within 24 hours will be rewarded with three of any type of
Poké Ball
, except for
Master Balls
,
Premier Balls
,
Cherish Balls
,
Safari Balls
, and
Park Balls
. He will also award a
Heart Scale
along with them.
When you're done visiting Solaceon Town, head back to the three ledges and take the final set of ledges down into the
Solaceon Ruins
.

East of the town are the
Solaceon Ruins
. You will be able to catch all 28 forms of
Unown
here, and this is also the location of the HM for
Defog
. Make sure to encounter at least one wild Unown since no Trainer uses an Unown and you need it to complete your Sinnoh Pokédex.
Twenty of the Unown can be found in the dead-end rooms, and since not all of them can be randomly found in the same room, you will have to do some exploring. The remaining six forms are located in all the main hallways, excluding the entrance, and only one form can be found in each hallway.
If you have trouble reading the inscription at the north end of the entrance hallway, it says:

Follow the corresponding stairways to find a room with
HM05
(
Defog
), a
Nugget
, the
Mind Plate
, and the
Odd Incense
(for producing a
Mime Jr.
egg when breeding a
Mr. Mime
). Once Defog is in your possession, your mission here should be complete. A
Fire Stone
,
Water Stone
, and
Thunderstone
are hidden in the boulders in three of the dead end rooms.

The
Lost Tower
is a five-floor building on
Route 209
. While the first two floors are easy to navigate, on the last three you will need HM05 to remove the thick fog. If you come here during the

, you can find wild
Duskull
. Once you reach 5F, talk to both of the elderly ladies to receive the
Cleanse Tag
and
Spell Tag

Once you've left the Lost Tower, return north to Solaceon Town and heal up for the journey ahead, then go north to
