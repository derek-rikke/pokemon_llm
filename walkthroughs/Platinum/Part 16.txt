From here on out, Mt. Coronet is an enormous maze. You may want to use
Super Repels
in some areas, but the wild Pokémon are high-leveled enough to be good for training against. It would be a good idea to keep the
Dowsing Machine
app on the
Pokétch
screen, as there will be a lot of hidden items.
Anyway, the exit in the southwestern corner of the room leads to a dead-end ledge on
Route 207
, where you can pick up a previously-unreachable
Iron
and
Timer Ball
.

Back inside the mountain, don't forget to pick up
TM80
(
Rock Slide
), as the move it contains is very useful.
Once you reach the northern exit,
Looker
will show up. Knowing that both
Cyrus
and the Galactic
Commanders
are out of his league to fight, he'll let you go on ahead since you're the only one powerful enough to take them on. He will give you the
Black Flute
before you go. After that, go through the exit and you'll be in 3F.

When you arrive head to the set of stairs on the right to briefly return to 2F to find a hidden
Star Piece
. You'll also deal with your first two
Galactic Grunts
, who shouldn't be that much of a challenge if you use the right Pokémon. Afterwards, take the exit to the outdoors, and you'll find yourself in the summit area of Mt. Coronet!

You are now in the southern area of the summit. As it is constantly
hailing
here, non-
Ice-types
will receive damage in battle, though you can easily use Super Repels to prevent battles. Also, this area is full of hidden items. From where you are, head east and then north to the Rock Climb-able wall. Near the large patch of grass is the western entrance to 4F, and near another scalable wall is the eastern entrance. Climb that wall and you'll find a grassy area with some hidden items. The eastern 4F entrance serves little purpose at this point, although there are a couple of hidden items worth picking up.
Back outside in the summit, make your way to the northwestern entrance to 4F, in the large grass patch.

Once inside from the west entrance, use Rock Climb to ascend to the upper area of 4F and head for the exit to the east, defeating two more Galactic grunts standing in your way.
Upper summit
Once through the exit from 4F, follow the path and take the stairs down and you will find a narrow chasm with two more Rock Climb walls and another cave entrance that will take you to a special tunnel.

You don't have to explore this part of the cave yet if you don't want to. You can battle three Galactic Grunts and find some hidden items in here. Also, a fourth grunt is guarding the entrance to a secret passage that leads to Mt. Coronet North Side's 1F. You can't go through here until you've stopped Team Galactic for good.
Summit
This time, ascend using the Rock Climb wall facing west and follow that path west. This will lead you to the entrance to 5F. Once again, there are some hidden items along the way.
