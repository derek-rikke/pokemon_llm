Starting the game
The player's room
Professor Rowan
The game loads with
Giratina
being shown on the bottom title screen. Press Start, A, or tap the screen to go to the main menu, then start a new game. You will be greeted by
Professor Rowan
, who will ask if you need advice about playing the game.
Afterward, Rowan will ask you about yourself. Here, choose your gender, name, and the name of
your rival
. None of these can be changed later on, so be sure you're happy with each choice before continuing to the next one.
After choosing your rival's name, you will be brought to your house in
Twinleaf Town
.

Fresh and Free!
The game starts in front of the TV at your house in
Twinleaf Town
. You are watching the tail end of a show featuring
Professor Rowan
. As you try to move, you will be greeted by your
rival
, who will briefly be distracted by your
PC
, and will then tell you to meet him outside as he dashes off. Follow him downstairs, where you'll have a short conversation with your
mom
. Just before you leave, your mom will tell you to stay away from the
tall grass
.
Twinleaf Town is cold, with patches of
snow
on the ground. As you explore the town, be sure to visit the house in the north-west corner of the town. Here, your rival will bump into you as you try to enter. He'll head back in immediately, however, because he forgot something. Head upstairs and your rival will ask you to meet him at
Route 201
. Leave his house and head north. Soon, you'll find yourself on Route 201.
Route 201
Route 201
Lake Verity
is to the west of
Route 201
, while
Sandgem Town
is to the east. As you go north, you meet up with your rival for a chat. He suggests that the two of you go to
Sandgem Town
to get Pokémon from Professor Rowan. When you point out you shouldn't go into the tall grass, he naively suggests running through the tall grass so fast that wild Pokémon have no chance to jump out at you (running through tall grass actually increases the chance that you'll be attacked by a wild Pokémon). Just as he's about to enter the grass, an old man shouts at him to halt.
The man is Professor Rowan, and he is not happy! He tells you two not to go to tall grass, then quizzes you about your love for Pokémon; eventually
Dawn
/
Lucas
will appear, and the professor will ask you to pick your very first Pokémon.

Turtwig
has high HP, Attack, and Defense, and its final evolution gains
Ground
as a secondary type; few moves are
super effective
or
not very effective
against this combination. Its Grass/Ground typing will be effective in more
Gyms
than Piplup, but in fewer than Chimchar.
Chimchar
has high Attack, Special Attack, and Speed. Its second evolution gains the
Fighting
type, a combination that is very effective against the most Gyms out of the three choices, not to mention the Pokémon League. It can also learn the powerful
Fire Blast
and
Focus Blast
relatively early, while the other two are still relying on weaker moves like
Razor Leaf
and
Bubblebeam
. However, its very low Defense and Special Defense mean it will be vulnerable even to types it resists.
Piplup
is similar to Turtwig; it has high Defense and Special Attack, and its final form gains
Steel
as the secondary type. This combination will resist many different move types, though it gains a
Ground
weakness. Piplup's moves are neutrally effective against more Gyms, but its wide range of resistances combined with its high Defense allow it to take quite the pounding.
Once you made your choice, in true
Rival
fashion, Barry will pick the one that has the type advantage over your choice. Rowan will point out that these Pokémon are inexperienced with the world and need you to help them grow before he and Lucas/Dawn return to Sandgem Town. Barry will then challenge you to an immediate battle. You don't have to win this battle, but winning awards
Experience
points for your new first partner Pokémon, as well as a small amount of spending money.

After the battle you will immediately go home.
Twinleaf Town
Back at home, your mom is happy that you and Barry met Professor Rowan, since he stopped you from being attacked by wild Pokémon. She then asks for you to thank him properly in Sandgem Town and gives you the ever-useful

Route 201
After arriving back on Route 201, you'll meet up with
Barry
again. He reveals that he's also planning to go to
Sandgem Town
, and he asks you to come with him to
Lake Verity
first to find and catch the rumored legendary Pokémon to show to Professor Rowan.
Lake Verity (first visit)
Once at Lake Verity you will see
Cyrus
, the leader of
Team Galactic
. He boasts to the legendary Pokémon of the lake that he will one day take control of Time and Space, then leaves the scene. When Barry is ready to press forward, you will hear this
legendary Pokémon
, and he is ready to catch it only to realize that neither of you have any
Poké Balls
to catch it with. Barry then recalls that Professor Rowan said to come to him if they needed anything, so Barry then departs for Sandgem Town. With nothing more to do here, follow him south and then east along Route 201.

Once you arrive at
Sandgem Town
, Lucas/Dawn are waiting to escort you inside Rowan's laboratory. Just as you're about to enter, Barry comes rushing out, commenting that Rowan is not as scary as he appears to be, before he dashes off. Once inside, the Professor takes a look at your Pokémon and approvingly allows you to keep it. Seeing the growing bond between you and your Pokémon, the Professor gives you a
Pokédex
and requests that you travel across Sinnoh and record data on the various Pokémon you meet.

, and maybe even buy some

Finally, head west out of Sandgem and use the ledges to return to Twinleaf.

Now, return to Sandgem.
