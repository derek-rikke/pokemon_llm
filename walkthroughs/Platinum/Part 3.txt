Oreburgh Gym
Interior of Oreburgh Gym.
This Gym, as you have probably figured out, specializes in
Rock-type
Pokémon. The toughest Pokémon you'll face is Level 14, so be prepared. Rock-type moves are
supereffective
against
Bug
-,
Flying
-,
Ice
-, and
Fire
-types, so obviously you don't want to use Pokémon of those types in this battle. Also, you will want Pokémon with
Water
-,
Grass
-,
Fighting
-, and/or
Ground
-type attacks. You should bring a few
Potions
to this battle, just in case.
After retrieving
Roark
from the mine, you may enter the Gym and battle the two Trainers, or you can take the first set of stairs, go across the bridge and walk up the second set of stairs to avoid battling. Then, you may challenge Gym Leader Roark.

Roark's first two Pokémon shouldn't be too much trouble. The
Geodude
knows
Rock Throw
and
Stealth Rock
, and its best stat is
Defense
. Stealth Rock will damage any Pokémon you switch into battle (Most Pokémon will lose 1/8 of their
HP
if hit. It will damage more if the Pokémon is weak to Rock-type moves, and less if it is resistant.). Rock Throw is just an attack, which is thankfully somewhat inaccurate. A good Grass- or Water-type attack will likely take Geodude out in one hit. Roark's
Onix
may be a bit more challenging, mostly because it has more Defense and
Speed
, and can use
Screech
to lower your Pokémon's Defense in addition to Rock Throw and Stealth Rock. If you get hit with Screech, you may want to switch before Roark sends out
Cranidos
. Cranidos is rather fast for this point of the game, and has a scary amount of
Attack
that will do massive damage with
Headbutt
or
Pursuit
, particularly if Onix used Screech or if Cranidos previously used
Leer
against you. Try switching in a Pokémon with
Intimidate
like
Shinx
to lower Cranidos's threat, but beware of Stealth Rock. It doesn't have the best defenses though, so one Water, Grass, or Fighting-type attack should send it out for the count.
After being defeated, Roark will give you the
Coal Badge
and
TM76
(
Stealth Rock
). The Badge will give you the ability to use
Rock Smash
outside of battle.
Your business in Oreburgh is done for now. Next, you'll be returning to
Jubilife City
so you can travel north to
Floaroma Town
.
Oreburgh Gate (optional)
Now that you can use
Rock Smash
, you can pick up some items in
Oreburgh Gate
that were inaccessible before.

Afterwards, you'll learn it has to do with the Professor's study on Pokémon evolution and the energy the Pokémon releases when it evolves. Although the Professor believes it's something beyond their control, Team Galactic seems interested in trying to harness its power. After they leave, a person from Jubilife TV will come and give you the
Fashion Case
as a reward for this amazing performance and tells you that the TV station is now open to visitors. Additionally, the Global Trade Station will also be open.
Jubilife TV
The
Pokémon Lottery Corner
is located on the ground floor of the
Jubilife TV
building, where it is conducted by a receptionist named
Felicity
. The winning ID number changes daily, and the game looks for matches by examining the IDs of all Pokémon in the player's party and in all PC boxes (but not Pokémon in the
Day Care
). You may check for matches multiple times in one day; however, after winning a prize, you may not participate again for the rest of the day.

On the second floor, Trainers can dress up their Pokémon using their
Accessories
. The saved photo of a dressed-up Pokémon is displayed in the gallery just outside the Fitting Room, along with up to ten photos from Trainers that the player has
mixed records
with. After dressing up a Pokémon and taking a photo, an
Interviewer
will appear outside of the entrance to the gallery to ask the player about the photo. In the main area, a man will give the player the mask of their
first partner Pokémon
.

On the third floor there are two rooms off-shooting from the main room: the Group Ranking Room and the Global Ranking Room, which detail rankings from players in the player's
group
and all players, respectively. There are three machines in each room, each detailing different concepts to be ranked in. A man in the yellow-carpeted area is a TV producer who asks the player for their opinion on TV. By answering EVERYONE HAPPY for the first question and Wi-Fi CONNECTION for the second question, the player can unlock
Mystery Gift
. Additionally, certain phrases that vary based on game version, language, and
Trainer ID number
can be told to the TV producer to unlock eight special wallpapers. The passwords can be retrieved from the Daisuki Club website or
Pokéwiki.de's secret phrase generator
.
Several people are on the fourth floor, but there is nothing of interest here.
Global Trade Station
The Global Trade Station (GTS for short) is the worldwide network over which you can trade Pokémon via the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. Now that you have Coal Badge, the GTS is also open. There is a large globe called the Geonet, which you can indicate their location, and on which small dots representing players you have traded with will appear. When you first logs on to Geonet, you will be asked where you live in. Talk to the woman at the counter. She will direct you into a room in which you can either put up a Pokémon to be traded or trade a Pokémon you own for one that has been put up.
Pokémon searches, after being confined to one species that has been seen by the player, can be further narrowed down to level, gender and the country where the person is trading it from is. By level, players can search for and request Pokémon Lv.9 or below, Lv.10 or above, Lv.20 or above and so on until Lv.100, or they can search for Pokémon of any level. Gender is similar, with the player being able to search for male, female or either gender of the selected Pokémon; searching for genderless species automatically sets the gender to 'either'.
Pokémon offerings are similarly governed, as the requested Pokémon in return cannot be any Pokémon that the player has not seen. Pokémon that are offered cannot be bargained, as the player has to choose one Pokémon he or she wants for it, instead of having a more flexible list. Like normal trades, a Pokémon can also hold an item when being offered or traded. Pokémon that evolve after a trade will do so in the same manner they would after a normal trade. The GTS also allows individuals to trade between two different games without having two Nintendo DS systems. It is recommended to check up on a deposited Pokémon every so often, as the Pokémon may flee if it is kept in the GTS for an extended period of time.
Afterwards you can travel to the
Pokétch Company
and get an upgrade for your Pokétch from the company president. You can get three more upgrades later in the game when you get three, five, and seven Badges. Anyway, head through the north exit to
Route 204
. You may want to heal up at the Pokémon Center first, as there are a lot of Trainers.

every day
. If you have the
Event Pokémon
Shaymin
in your party, you can show it to the young woman near the entrance to receive the
Gracidea
flower. Since this is the first area in which you can encounter wild Berries, you can collect and then replant some. The Sprayduck can help you collect more Berries if you water the plants correctly within their growth cycle. Tell the girl in the north-western house that you like berries and she'll hand over
TM88
(

).
After this, exit Floaroma Town to the east and continue walking to
Route 205
. Near the bridge, a young girl comes up to you and asks you to rescue her papa from the
Valley Windworks
. In order to get inside the Windworks, you need to pick up the key from Floaroma Meadow and defeat the grunt guarding the door. You can do these two tasks in either order after talking to the girl.

As you enter
