There are many Trainers to battle on

, however, two of them cannot be fought until much later in the game, when you have the necessary HMs. Go across the first section of the bridge, make a quick detour north to grab a Great Ball, then continue east down the stairs, and through the tall grass, and you will be at the entrance of
Hearthome City
.
Also on this Route is the
Berry Master's house
. Each day, he will give you a fresh
Berry
. You may also get the Berry Searcher Pokétch app that shows where there are Berries ready to pick. His wife sells
Mulch
, which affects the growth of Berries.

On arriving at
Hearthome City
, a lost
Buneary
will run into you, shortly followed by
its Trainer
, who will thank you for catching her Buneary, and suggest that you visit the
Super Contest
Hall (the large building near the
Hearthome Gym
). Once you get there, you'll find her talking to your
mom
. They will both talk to you about Super Contests and leave. Go to the front desk and talk to the woman dressed in purple. She will reveal herself as
Fantina
, this city's
Gym Leader
, and return to the Gym where you will be able to challenge her.
After that, you can take a look around the city. Next to the
Pokémon Center
is
Bebe
's house, where
Sinnoh
's administrator of the
PC box system
lives. If you talk to her and have a spare slot in your party, she'll hand over an
Eevee
. If you're into
Pokémon breeding
, consider saving your game before you receive the Eevee, since there is only a 12.5% chance it will be a female and otherwise, you'll have to wait until you have the National Dex to find a
Ditto
or another Eevee.

East of the
Poké Mart
is the
Pokémon Fan Club
. Go inside and talk to the man with the hat inside. After listening to his rambles, he will give you the
Poffin Case
, which is essential for making
Poffins
. Poffins can be made in the building west of the Poké Mart, known as the
Poffin House
. Near the
Poffin House
is
Mr. Goods
. Although he claims he can't remember who he is or his real name, he has dedicated himself to seeking rarities. He gives
goods
to
Trainers
once they have met certain requirements. These items can be placed in the Trainer's
Secret Base
located in the
Underground
.
Next to the
Pokémon Fan Club
is the Pokémon Hotel. If you go to the second floor and talk to the woman with the
Clefairy
, she will give you a
Shell Bell
, which heals the user by 1/8 of its max HP when it inflicts damage.

Amity Square
, where you can find some
Accessories
, an
Amulet Coin
,
TM43
(
Secret Power
), and
TM45
(
Attract
), but you'll need to make a trip from each entrance to get all the items. Keep in mind that you'll need a "cute" Pokémon to enter - your first partner Pokémon in any of its evolutionary forms will work. Additionally, each hut contains three teleporters that can warp you to a different hut. To access them, enter the hut but stop on the tile just inside the entrance. Take a step forward, right, or left to access the hidden teleporters. It is the only way to access the area where you can obtain the
Spooky Plate
. A chubby man in overalls goes around Amity Square every day. To reach him, players must go through the east gate and use the teleporters. When found, he will give the player five
Berries
or one
Accessory
.
Hearthome Gym
Hearthome City Gym
Once you're done exploring the town, head to the
Hearthome Gym
, located in the northeast corner of the city. The Gym leader,
Fantina
, uses
Ghost-type
Pokémon, which are weak to
Dark
- and
Ghost
-type moves. Ghost-types are also immune to
Normal
- and
Fighting
-type moves, but Normal-type Pokémon are immune to Ghost-type moves in return. The gym's structure is two darkened rooms each with a maze of
Duskull
lamps. Although you're given a flashlight at the entrance, it's still easy to see everything on the screen. The goal of the puzzle is to find a blue tile, note down the shape on it, then go to the door that has the same pattern. If you pick the wrong door, you'll find yourself back at the beginning (note that if you leave the gym and reenter, the symbol on the blue tile is randomized, so it probably won't be the same). After the second maze, you'll find Fantina - challenge her to a battle to earn the
Relic Badge
.

Typically of Ghost-types, Fantina's Pokémon are all pain to deal with, particularly her
Mismagius
. If you chose
Turtwig
as your first partner Pokémon or have added a
Shinx
to your team, their jaws should be able to
Bite
through Fantina's team with little problem. Her
Duskull
has high defense stats and may take a few hits to take down. It has
Will-O-Wisp
to
burn
and halve the Attack stat of an affected Pokémon, making it lose 1/8 of its HP each turn. Apply
Burn Heals
right away. It also has
Pursuit
and
Shadow Sneak
, Pursuit doing more damage if you try to
switch out
and Shadow Sneak
always going first
, like
Quick Attack
.
Future Sight
will do damage to any Pokémon, regardless of type, after two turns. Do not forget Future Sight, as it could take you out just as you think you're winning and have low HP. Contrary to her Duskull, her
Haunter
has very high Special Attack and Speed, but has no Special based attacks, and has quite low defenses. It has
Shadow Claw
, a Ghost-type attack with a high critical hit ratio, and
Sucker Punch
, which will strike before you for 80 power, but only works if you are attacking that turn. Like Duskull, Haunter's role is annoyance, and it will disrupt you with
Confuse Ray
before going in for
Hypnosis
to set you up for Fantina's Mismagius. Mismagius comes packing the powerful move
Shadow Ball
, a Ghost-type attack that synergises with Mismagius' high Sp. Atk. Not good! It also has
Psybeam
and
Magical Leaf
backing it up, with Confuse Ray to disrupt as well.
Staravia
would do well here as it is immune to Shadow Ball and its typing halves the damage from Magical Leaf.
Once Fantina is defeated, she gives you the Relic Badge and
TM65
(
Shadow Claw
). You can also use
Defog
outside of battle, which will come in handy later on
Route 210
.
Route 209
Having earned your Relic Badge, you've now done everything there is to do in Hearthome. It's time to move east to
Route 209
, however before leaving, consider purchasing
Great Balls
from the
Poké Mart
- they have a 50% higher catch rate than regular Poké Balls. Make sure your team is fully healed, because as you enter the Gate that separates Hearthome City from Route 209, you'll encounter
Barry
, who will challenge you to another battle.

This time around he'll have two new Pokémon that represent the types of the
first partner Pokémon
that he didn't pick at the beginning of the game. Additionally, both his first partner Pokémon and his
Starly
have evolved into their second forms. He shouldn't be that tough if you have a well leveled team, since your selection of Pokémon is much greater than it was last time.

From the entrance, go east, then north to travel directly to
Solaceon Town
, collecting any items that are of interest to you. On this route, there is the Broken Tower, which becomes the
Hallowed Tower
when an
Odd Keystone
(available from a Black Belt on
Route 208
, hidden in
Twinleaf Town
, or mineable in the
Underground
) is placed in it. After speaking to 32 people in the Underground, a
level

Spiritomb
will appear to battle you. You will pass the
Lost Tower
near the end of the route, but you will need to get
HM05
(
Defog
) first for dealing with the
fog
on the higher floors. Fortunately, HM05 is available not far from here, so pass it by for now. Follow the path north to reach
Solaceon Town
.
