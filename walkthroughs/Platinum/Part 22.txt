A colored background means that the Pokémon can be found in this location in the specified game. A white background with a colored letter means that the Pokémon cannot be found here.
There are many Pokémon that can be found here without any interaction with the
Trophy Garden
's owner,
Mr. Backlot
. All of these Pokémon are in the
Sinnoh Pokédex
, and many can be found in other areas. After you have gotten the
National Pokédex
upgrade, however, you can talk to
Mr. Backlot
and he will mention a particular rare Pokémon in his garden. That Pokémon will be placed in the Trophy Garden by Backlot's butler to cover up for his fibs. The butler can place a different one there daily. The last two Pokémon placed in the garden at any given time will remain available until more Pokémon are placed in the garden.
Pal Park
Fly to Pal Park. Now you're free to go inside! You'll meet Professor Oak who will explain that Pal Park can be used to import Pokémon from
Hoenn
and
Kanto
. He gives you the
Trainer Counter
app for your Pokétch and then leaves for
Eterna City
. You can import Pokémon from Pokémon
Ruby, Sapphire
,
Emerald
,
FireRed, and LeafGreen Versions
, by inserting the GBA cartridge into the front slot of your
Nintendo DS
or
DS Lite
and selecting "Migrate" from the opening menu.
You can get the
Kitchen Timer
app from a girl in
Pal Park
's lobby after showing a
Snorlax
to her and the
Color Changer
app after receiving the Kitchen Timer and showing a
Kecleon
to her.
You will need to import
Regirock
,
Regice
, and
Registeel
in order to catch
Regigigas
in the
Snowpoint Temple
, unless you have an
event Regigigas
.
Canalave City
Your next destination is
Canalave City
. Enter Sailor
Eldritch
's house in the southwestern area of town. You'll see that his son is trapped in a nightmare. Talk to his mother and you'll learn that you need to find an item called the
Lunar Wing
on
Fullmoon Island
to save him. Talk to Sailor Eldritch and he will take you to Fullmoon Island.

Follow the path and head into the forest clearing where

is. When you interact with her, she will flee, but she leaves the Lunar Wing behind. Return to Eldritch and have him take you back to Canalave City, then return to the house and use the Lunar Wing to heal his son. As for Cresselia, she's similar to
Mesprit
,
Zapdos
,
Articuno
, and
Moltres
— she is
roaming
around the Sinnoh region so you need to use the Marking Map to track her.

You will need
Regirock
,
Regice
, and
Registeel
in your party for this mission if you want to battle and catch
Regigigas
. Your only option is to migrate them from
Ruby, Sapphire
, and
Emerald
through
Pal Park
or, with the aid of a Regigigas received from a special
event
,
catch them
before returning here. If you're planning to catch Regigigas, you will want a Pokémon with
False Swipe
and plenty of
Nest Balls
.
When you approach the temple, the guard states that you are not qualified to enter, but
Candice
appears and says that you are.

Sliding on the ice is a bit tricky. First, slide until you got to the part where there is no ice. Next slide ←, ↑, →, then ↑ to reach the stairs. You can now go to B4F.

While there is nothing to worry about you can use

Snowpoint Temple B5F
While this new sliding puzzle looks difficult, it can be easy with the right steps. From the tile next to the first rock nearest your entry point travel ↓ to reach the unfrozen tile southwest of Regigigas. Now very carefully slide in this order: ↓, →, ↑, ←, ↓, →, ↑ to reach Regigigas. If you have the three Regis in your party, Regigigas will awaken and face you when you interact with it.
Save the game

It may come as a bit of a shock that Regigigas is only Level 1! Use False Swipe to reduce its HP bar to the red zone and then throw
Dusk Balls
or
Nest Balls
until you catch it. Hopefully, it won't be too much trouble.
Once it's captured, exit the temple and
Fly
to
Celestic Town
.
Mt. Coronet (south)
Tunnel
Before heading out, make sure that you have Pokémon with the HMs
Surf
,
Waterfall
,
Strength
,
Rock Smash
, and
Rock Climb
.
Backtrack your way to the area where you were first outside in the summit earlier.
(See
this section
for a refresher on how to get there.)
Then, use the eastern entrance to the part of Mt. Coronet 4F below the waterfall. Climb the waterfall and go inside the cave to find the
Adamant Orb
and the
Lustrous Orb
(as well as the hidden
Stone Plate
). You will need both Orbs to catch
Dialga
and
Palkia
.
If you return to the tunnel, since
Team Galactic
is gone now, you can go through the door that was previously inaccessible. That will take you to Mt. Coronet's north area, where you can find
TM02
(
Dragon Claw
) (as well as the hidden
Nugget
on the rock just north of it).
Celestic Town
In order to battle
Dialga
and
Palkia
, you must first talk to
Cynthia's grandmother
. If you got the
Adamant Orb
or
Lustrous Orb
at
Mt. Coronet
earlier after beating the
Sunyshore Gym
, Cynthia's grandmother will explain their connection to
Dialga
and
Palkia
. Now, they will appear when you return to
Spear Pillar
.
Fly to
Oreburgh City
and go north from there to Mt. Coronet's entrance. You'll need the HMs
Surf
,
Strength
,
Rock Smash
, and
Rock Climb
, as well as several
Timer Balls
,
Net Balls
, or
Dusk Balls
. It's time to head back to Spear Pillar!
(See
this section
if you need a refresher on how to get there.)
Spear Pillar
Here, you'll see a blue dimensional rift which is another dimension where Dialga is.
Save your game
, then interact with it to challenge Dialga. After that, step back inside Mt. Coronet and quickly return. This time, a purple-colored rift will appear: Palkia.

When you face them, be careful as they are at Lv. 70. Make sure your team is at least Lv. 65 or higher. Weaken them with
normally-effective
moves and inflict either
paralysis
or
sleep
. They have
Earth Power
to counter
Steel-types
that could withstand their other moves, but certain Steel-types like
Skarmory
or
Bronzong
still work for the resistance tactic as their additional types (or
ability
) prevent supereffective damage. Additionally,
Shedinja
is immune to all their moves.
Net Balls will make it easier to catch Palkia, as it is part Water-type. When playing at
night
,
Dusk Balls
will work great on both Legendaries.
Turnback Cave
Turnback Cave Entrance
Pillar Room
It's time to return to
Turnback Cave
and the
Distortion World
to catch
Giratina
if you didn't already. If you didn't catch Giratina yet, you'll want to take about 40
Dusk Balls
with you. Either way, there is an important item to pick up. Return to
Route 214
and head through
Spring Path
, which will take you back to Sendoff Spring. Enter
Turnback Cave
at the north side of the lake.
Use
Defog
to remove the
fog
. Read the pillar that says
"...Past three pillars...to the sleeping... ...before 30 is surpassed..."
. It means that to access the room with a portal to the
Distortion World
, you must find 3 rooms with a pillar before going through 30 rooms. This cave is highly unusual in that the layout of rooms is randomized each time you visit. Inside the maze, for a hint on which doorway to take, study the
breakable rocks
and go through the doorway that the odd pattern points to. The further you go, the stronger the wild Pokémon will be.

Another chance at catching Giratina
Once you've gotten past the three pillars and got whichever item was waiting for you, you'll find the room with the portal to the Distortion World. If you failed to catch

last time, you'll find it guarding the portal. This time, it's in

One slight advantage if you decided to KO Giratina in the Distortion World earlier is that in Altered Forme, it prioritizes defenses over offense, so its attacks are not as strong. Its moveset is still the same, though.
Save before facing it
; otherwise you'll have to defeat the Elite Four again to get another chance to catch it. If it does come to that, rechallenge the Elite Four before completing the mission at
Stark Mountain
. Otherwise, their teams' levels are increased, making it harder to defeat them.
In this battle, use the same tactics as you did when facing
Azelf
and
Uxie
and you'll be fine.
When ready, use the portal to return to the Distortion World.
