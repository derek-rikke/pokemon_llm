Pastoria Gym
As you will quickly figure out, this Gym specializes in
Water-types
.
Grass
- and
Electric
-types will do well here, but you shouldn't use
Fire
-,
Rock
-, or
Ground
-types. The strongest Pokémon here is level 37, so make sure your team is leveled appropriately before challenging the Gym.
The puzzle of the Pastoria Gym may appear complicated at first, having to raise and lower the water level by stepping on buttons in the correct order. In reality, there is only ever a single path that you can take at any one time without going back the way you came. To reach
Crasher Wake
(the Gym Leader), go down the entrance stairs, turn left and go up those stairs. You will reach a yellow button. Hit it and the water level drops. Turn right, down the stairs, and go through a narrow passage. There is another narrow passage before you reach some stairs. Climb up to the top, and hit the green button. Climb down and follow the path to another set of stairs. Battle the
Sailor
there, and hit the blue button. Follow the platform to the first yellow button and head right, past the stairs to the
Tuber
. Battle him, and follow the path right to another Tuber. Battle her, and go on forward. You will eventually find a green button. Hit it, go down the nearby stairs, and hit the yellow button. Go up, then down to the lowest level. The rest is simple; follow the path to a set of stairs, climb up, and hit the blue button. The path to Wake is clear.

Wake leads the fight with
Gyarados
, who has
Intimidate
, so lead with
Special
-based attackers. It knows Wake's signature move,
Brine
. Brine does more damage if its target has less than half of its HP left, so be wary and keep your Pokémon healthy.
Waterfall
will do the most damage and may cause your Pokémon to
flinch
. However, one good
Electric-type
attack, such as
Spark
or
Thunder
, will take it out. Next up is Wake's
Quagsire
, whose Ground type makes it immune to Electric-type moves. Grass-type attacks are this Pokémon's nightmare, particularly Special attacks due to its weak
Special Defense
. It has
Rock Tomb
which can slow you down, but it doesn't know Brine.
Yawn
can be annoying, because a Pokémon hit by it will fall asleep on the next turn unless you switch it out.
Chesto Berries
as held items can be useful in this situation. Last up is his star Pokémon,
Floatzel
. Floatzel is very fast, and can hit pretty hard, but its defenses are quite low. It has
Ice Fang
to counter Grass-types, as well as
Aqua Jet
, a Water-type version of
Quick Attack
. It too is packing Brine, so stay healthy during the fight. A Pokémon with a good Electric move will do well here.
After defeating Wake, you'll receive the
Fen Badge
that lets you use
Surf
outside of battle, as well as
TM55
(
Brine
).
After earning the Fen Badge, you'll meet up with Barry again. When Wake leaves the Gym, it turns out that Barry's earlier claim that he's Wake's apprentice isn't true - Wake won't take him on as he believes neither of you need any tutoring. After this exchange Barry mentions a Galactic Grunt with a bomb near the Great Marsh's Observatory Gate. When you meet Barry and Wake at the entrance to the Great Marsh you'll find that the Grunt sets off a small bomb in the Great Marsh as a field test, and you'll have to chase after him while Barry keeps people out of the Great Marsh until Wake can be sure it is safe.

The interior of the mansion
The
Pokémon Mansion
is owned by
Mr. Backlot
. It is also the home of the famous
Trophy Garden
, which is located at its rear. It has four rooms, the most important of them being Mr. Backlot's office, which is where a Pokémon statue guarded by a policeman is located. The guard is on break from 2 A.M. until 6 A.M., leaving you free to touch the statue and get your fingerprints all over it.
Manaphy
's data can be recorded (as a seen Pokémon) from the book lying on Mr. Backlot's desk, and it must be done in order to get the
National Pokédex
. Other rooms in the mansion have beds, which you can use to rest yourself along with your Pokémon. In the west wing, you may fight the maids in the 5-Maid Knockout Exact-Turn Attack Challenge, in which five maids must be beaten in a certain number of total turns (no more, no less). The prize for beating the challenge is a duel with either
Lady
Celeste or
Rich Boy
Liam, depending on how many turns you were told to beat the maids in.
The western and eastern exits of the mansion are blocked by the maids. Neither of these doorways are functional however, and for your purposes serve only as decoration.

(you'll encounter
Looker
there), chasing the Grunt east towards Valor Lakefront. After talking to the man in the hotel lobby and healing up, chase the Grunt all the way to the
Valor Lakefront
, where he'll finally give up and you can challenge him to a battle near the entrance of
Lake Valor
. After defeating the Grunt, you will meet
Cynthia
and
your rival
again. He briefly interrupts her to report that the damage to the Great Marsh is not as serious as expected, and Cynthia states that she is worried about the group of
Psyduck
on
Route 210
. She gives you
SecretPotion
to cure them of their headaches, and will then tell you the legend about a
mirage Pokémon
that lives inside the lake.
