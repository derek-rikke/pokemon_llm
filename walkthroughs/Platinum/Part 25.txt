After you go north for a little bit,
Buck
will appear. After recognizing that Team Galactic is here, he will decide to team up with you as a
tag partner
. Like Marley and the other tag partners, he will also heal your team after every battle and Wild battles become double battles.

This room is so large it is recommended to stock up on
Max Repels
to make traveling through it a little less annoying. It is also highly recommended to take down the Trainers in this room as while you have Buck with you, since he can heal your team and the Trainers' Pokémon are between Level 57 and Level 61. Just remember that some items are inaccessible right now since you can't use Rock Climb as long as Buck is with you.
To make it easier to find the exit, head east past the first set of stairs until you see the path turn north. Keep going straight until you reach a dead end. Go down the nearby stairs and follow the path west, smashing a rock on the way. Continue until you climb some stairs and see two Trainers nearby. Turn left and follow the path to the northwestern part of the room. Go down some nearby stairs and move the Strength boulder. Then, you will be at the exit. Once there, Buck recognizes Team Galactic is inside and heads in.
Heatran's Room
Heatran's Room
Inside, Charon is unhappy that Mars and Jupiter quit and won't help him. He plans to use Heatran to control the volcanic eruption to gain millions. Noticing you and Buck, Charon quickly grabs the Magma Stone and gloats. However, a mysterious Trainer sends out a
Croagunk
to get the stone. This trainer is actually
Looker
in disguise and, as much as Charon denies it, Looker has him arrested while the two Galactic grunts with Charon run away.
Taking both you and Buck outside, while Buck goes to return the stone, Looker mentions his investigation into Charon's activities. He also states that now that Charon was arrested, Team Galactic is no longer a threat. After Buck returns,
Fly
to the
Survival Area
.
Survival Area
When you arrive, you will see Buck and Barry right by the house that was locked up earlier. This house is Buck's, and it is also the
Battleground
, where you can
rechallenge
the Sinnoh Gym Leaders and all five of your previous
Multi Battle
partners. There are four Trainers in here each day, and they can only be battled once a day. Talk to Buck and his grandfather, who will tell you the legend about Stark Mountain. This is important— if you don't talk to both,
Heatran
will not appear when you go back to Stark Mountain. Besides the Gym Leaders, the Elite Four's teams have also been upgraded as well, providing a harder challenge should you revisit the
Pokémon League
. Barry will also remain outside the Battleground building and on weekends, you can rechallenge him to a battle once a day.
