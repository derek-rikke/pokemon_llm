Heatran is Level 50 and can be a dangerous attacker. Use a
Water
- or
Fighting
-type move to take out a chunk of its HP, then continue hitting with weaker attacks until its HP bar turns red. Then, throw Dusk Balls until you catch it. To avoid the risk of getting defeated by Heatran, heal your team often.

On this route, there is a constant
Sandstorm
, which causes minor damage to Pokémon that aren't
Rock
,
Ground
, or
Steel
-types on every turn. You will need both your
Bicycle
and the HM
Rock Smash
for this area. The nearby cave is the entrance to the
Rock Peak Ruins
where, if you have an
event
Regigigas
in your party, you will find
Regirock
where you have
a chance
to catch it. If not, it is an ordinary cave where you will find a
Hard Stone
and a hidden
Nugget
northeast of it.
This route can be a bit of a puzzle to navigate. You'll need to use the
muddy slopes and logs
to access the
Berry
patch and all of the items. For a shortcut out of this route, from the area where you started, head for the northern area and follow the path with your bike and you'll only have to deal with a few Trainers and breakable rocks.
Move Tutor
The northern house on this route belongs to one of the
Move Tutors
. He can teach the ultimate moves of the
first partner Pokémon
to their final forms as long as their
happiness
factor is maxed out. The moves he teaches are
Frenzy Plant
for the
Grass
first partner Pokémon,
Blast Burn
for the
Fire
first partner Pokémon, and
Hydro Cannon
for the
Water
first partner Pokémon.

This should be a straightforward route. In the patch of
long grass
, a man is hiding in the trees who will give you two
Nuggets
if you talk with him twice. Also, one of the Trainers is hidden. You will need
Cut
for finding two of the items. In the southernmost area where two of the Trainers are, there are two paths. Going west will take you to
Route 230
while going east takes you to the
Resort Area
. Let's go to the Resort Area first.

There isn't much to do here. This is the only place in the game besides
Twinleaf Town
not to have a
Poké Mart
or another store.
Ribbon Syndicate
The
Ribbon Syndicate
is the large building in the northeastern part of town. This is a very hard building to get into as you must have 10 different kinds of
Ribbon
on your current party just to be permitted entry. You'll need to participate in a lot of different
Super Contests
to achieve this.
Like with the massage therapist in
Veilstone City
, there is a spa treatment, receivable once per day, that will increase a Pokémon's
happiness
factor. One difference is that it can also be used on
Pokémon Eggs
, enabling the Pokémon that hatches from that Egg to already possess that increased happiness factor. Also, you can purchase rare, highly expensive Ribbons not found elsewhere.
Villa
Located in the southeastern area of town. Once you arrive, the previous owner will turn over the
Villa
to you and help you get a
table
. You can purchase other furniture with the booklet found on the table, allowing you to decorate in a similar way to the
Underground
Secret Base
. The
Sinnoh
Gym Leaders
,
Professor Rowan
,
Lucas
/
Dawn
,
Barry
, and
your character's mother
may come and visit.

For the last numbered route in the game, this is pretty easy to navigate.
Surf
west to reach the
Fight Area
. If you have a
Grass
- and an
Electric
-type with you, you should have no problems. You will need
Rock Smash
for the small island found on this route to reach all the items (two of which are hidden).
After arresting
Charon
and exploring every location, your mission in this game is mostly complete! All that's left is to work on completing the
National Pokédex
, which will require
trading
with other players. Obtaining all 481 non-
event
Pokémon is a big task, but it
is
possible! If you complete the National Pokédex, go to the
Hotel Grand Lake
on
Valor Lakefront
and talk with the
Game Freak director
to get your Diploma for completing your Pokédex.
Additionally, you can always challenge the
Elite Four
,
Battleground
, and
Battle Frontier
.
