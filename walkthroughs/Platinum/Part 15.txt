In-game trade
In the upper left hand house is a girl who will trade a
Haunter
named Gaspar that will hold an
Everstone

Gengar
) in exchange for a
Medicham
.
Snowpoint Gym
Snowpoint Gym
The secret to the puzzle of the Gym is to smash the snowballs on the ground is to slide in from above at a fast enough speed to smash them. Your main goal is that from the entrance, head straight to reach the Gym Leader, but only after you've smashed the snowballs that were in the way. Just slide around the Gym and predict which areas you need to slide down to smash those snowballs. Of course it will take some time to experiment until all the necessary snowballs are gone. You do not have to face all of the Gym Trainers in this Gym.
Candice's
Sneasel
is easily handeled by
Fighting-types
(though Fighting Pokémon must watch out for
Aerial Ace
), and her
Abomasnow
is easily beaten by a
Fire-type
. While
Piloswine
can hit hard, it is slow and has six different weaknesses. Her
Froslass
can be a bit of a problem, especially if Abomasnow's
Snow Warning
already activated, since
Hail
raises Froslass's evasion
and causes
Blizzard
to never miss. Froslass is weak to Fire,
Rock
,
Ghost
,
Dark
, so take it out with one of those types (or any strong attack) before it goes out of control with
Double Team
or Blizzard.

Once you've beaten Candice you will receive the Icicle Badge that will will allow you to use Rock Climb outside of battle as well as
TM72
(
Avalanche
) that while it causes your Pokémon to usually
move last
, it's power will double if that Pokémon was struck by a damaging move first.
Now that you can use Rock Climb (optional)
Now that have access to the move
Rock Climb
in the field, we can gain access to some items and fight some trainers around the region.

Use your new Galactic Key to open the locked door and head up to 2F.

You should now be in the middle area of 2F. Simply fight the grunts and then use each of the warp panels. This will earn you two items. Afterwards, use the warp panel that is located by the TVs to reach the meeting hall, where Cyrus is.
Meeting Hall
Galactic Meeting Hall
You will meet up with Looker here and listen to Cyrus giving his speech about how the world is incomplete and the fact that he now has the power to create a new one for Team Galactic's benefit. After he and the grunts leave, Looker leaves to investigate this further. Follow in the direction he went to find another warp panel that will take you to a new area of 2F.
2F
You'll be in the upper-right area of 2F where there are some beds to rest your Pokémon team. Hidden in the right-hand bed is a
Poké Doll
. Climb the stairs to 3F.
3F
After dealing with two Galactic Grunts you'll find three warp panels here. The upper right one takes you to an area where you can find a
Protein
. The upper left will get you a
Max Elixir
, and the lower left is the one you'll need to proceed to an area with stairs up to 4F.

Galactic HQ 4F
This is where Cyrus's office is located. After you open the locked door, Cyrus will greet you and mention that the new world is actually only for him, since he feels his underlings are just as flawed as the rest of the world. Finding you interesting, he'll challenge you to a battle.

His team is the same as the previous, except that two of his Pokémon have evolved. His first Pokémon,
Sneasel
, is easily vulnerable to
Fighting-types
. His other two
Crobat
and
Honchkrow
both are
Flying-type
and should be easily vulnerable to
Rock
,
Ice
and
Electric-types
. Just remember that Crobat is the faster of the two and may try to confuse your Pokémon with
Supersonic
, and Honchkrow possesses better physical attack moves that could KO your Pokémon if you are not careful.
Lake Trio room
Afterwards, Cyrus will give you a
Master Ball
and then leave. He mentions that if you want to save the
Lake Pokémon
, you should use the nearby warp panel to get to them. Use that warp panel and you will reach a hallway. At the end is where the Lake Trio are being held. Once you reach that room, where they are, you can overhear a conversation between
Charon
and
Saturn
about how Charon is happy with the new world Cyrus will create. Talk to Saturn and he'll challenge you to a battle since, unlike Cyrus, he will not let you roam freely and interfere with their plans.

Saturn's team is the same as before but at higher levels, so the same tactics you used at
Lake Valor
should work here. Once you defeat him, Saturn will let you press the switch that will set

free. He mentions that Cyrus crafted a special

Mt. Coronet
.
Return to Cyrus's office and a new pathway will have opened up with a warp panel that will take you to the green warp panel just inside one of the main doors of the Galactic HQ. Take it, exit the building, and heal up at the Pokémon Center.
Your biggest quest now awaits you. You will need a strong Pokémon team with the HM moves
Surf
,
Strength
,
Rock Smash
, and
Rock Climb
. You should stock up on
Super Repels
,
Moomoo Milks
,
Revives
, and maybe a few
Lava Cookies
.
Once you are prepared, your next destination is to enter Mt. Coronet from the south entrance. You can either
Fly
to
Oreburgh City
and head north, or
Hearthome City
and head west, but the path from Oreburgh is faster.
