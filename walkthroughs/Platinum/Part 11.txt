Now that
Cynthia
has given you the
SecretPotion
, talk to the
Psyduck
that have been blocking access to the north half of
Route 210
. Administer the SecretPotion and the Psyduck will move off. Cynthia will appear and give you the
Old Charm
, asking you to deliver it to
Celestic Town
.
Tall grass
grows rampant throughout this route, preventing the use of your
bicycle
. This area is a popular place for
Ninja Boys
to hide. Further north, the grass clears to give rise to thick
fog
. To ease travel,
HM05
(
Defog
) may be used, although this is not required.
Head north through the large patch of tall grass, but make sure you find all three members of the Ninja Trio and defeat them, as they won't challenge you unless you stand right next to them.
Grandma Wilma
, a
Move Tutor
, lives in a house on the northern, foggy stretch of Route 210 although you'll need
Rock Climb
to reach it. Previously, she lived in a famous city of
Dragon Tamers
, and is able to teach the move
Draco Meteor
to any
Dragon-type
Pokémon with high
friendship
. Turn west, then head up the stairs and across the first bridge. From there, carry on straight, across two narrow bridges to find the powerful
TM30
(
Shadow Ball
). Backtrack, and head south over the second wide bridge and then follow the path west to
Celestic Town
.

Celestic Town
is a tiny town that preserves the history of
Sinnoh
and the old ways of life. The center of town has a small shrine that dates back to ancient times. This town is the hometown of
Cynthia
's family. Although there is no
Poké Mart
in the town, an elderly couple run a shop out of their house. A man standing in the shop gives away three pairs of glasses to you depending on the time of day. He gives away
Choice Specs
in the morning,
BlackGlasses
during the day, and
Wise Glasses
at night. The Choice Specs powers up the holder's
Special moves
by 1.5 times, so be sure to take them if you have any special attacking Pokémon.
Next to the Pokémon Center is
Cynthia's grandmother
. Talk to her and she'll tell you about the
Galactic Grunt
guarding the entrance to the
ruins
, so head down the stairs and battle the Grunt at the north end of town.

Uxie

Mesprit
.
Team Galactic
's Boss
Cyrus
will show up, interested in the old Sinnoh legends, and after he and Cynthia's grandmother exchange their views on the current state of the world, you'll battle him.

This battle certainly shouldn't be the hardest you've yet had. Cyrus's
Sneasel
, although fast, has low defensive stats. A
Fighting-type
move is pretty much guaranteed to take it out in one hit. It's worth noting that Cyrus's entire team is weak to
Rock-type
moves as well.
After the battle, Cyrus will disappear in a flash and you'll be rewarded
HM03
(
Surf
) by Cynthia's grandmother. Once you leave the ruins, you'll meet up with Cynthia, who heard what happened and now understands that Team Galactic is more dangerous than she initially thought. She'll mention there is a library in
Canalave City
with books detailing Sinnoh's history, west of
Jubilife City
. Since it is the location of your next Gym Battle, you will need to head there eventually.
Now that you can use Surf (optional)

Starting from the bridge near the entrance to

's south half,
Surf
on the river northwest and eventually you'll reach
Fuego Ironworks
. Get off at the northern bank of the river. It's worth noting that outside of the Ironworks, you can find wild
Magnemite
.
Inside Fuego Ironworks your objective is getting to the boiler in the center, where the owner
Mr. Fuego
is. You will need to use the
spin tiles
to reach him. First head into the direction of the southeastern corner of the Ironworks at your own pace, but avoid the tile near Mr. Fuego as that one will take you through another tile that will cause you to start over. After accessing the (↓) tile in the southeastern area you will see three (←) in a line that lead to a larger patch of tiles. The northernmost (←) is the correct one to use and will get you to the area just to the right of the entrance to the boiler place.
Stars for Shards
Mr. Fuego will give you a
Star Piece
when you first meet him. From now on, you can trade a Star Piece for one of all four different-colored
Shards
