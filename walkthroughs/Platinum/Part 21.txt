Twinleaf Town
Now that the main game is over, the post-game begins. You'll find yourself in the place where the game originally began: your bedroom in
Twinleaf Town
. When you go downstairs,
your mother
will mention that
Barry
was just over and mentioned something about catching a ship at
Snowpoint City
.
By now, you should have all 210 Pokémon in your
Sinnoh Pokédex
sighted and in
Sandgem Town
you can receive the
National Pokédex
. If not, you may have missed some. Here is a list of regional Pokémon not owned by a Trainer in Sinnoh.
Rotom
: Found in the TV at the
Old Chateau
, but only at
night
.
Unown
: Found in the
Solaceon Ruins
.
Manaphy
: Picture found in a book on a desk in Mr. Backlot's office in his mansion on
Route 212
.
Mesprit, Azelf, and Uxie
: Found in their caverns at their respective lakes after the Giratina battle in the Distortion World.
Dialga and Palkia
: Counted as seen during the story event at Spear Pillar.
If you are ready, head to Sandgem Town.
Sandgem Town
Once
Professor Rowan
confirms that you have seen all the Pokémon in the Sinnoh Pokédex,
Professor Oak
will appear. Having heard of your exploits, he will reveal he is bringing components for the National Pokédex and your Pokédex is automatically upgraded. Before he leaves, he'll mention that
Pal Park
on
Route 221
is open. Now you can import Pokémon from the GBA games.
Professor Rowan will then give you the
Poké Radar
, which will allow you to find non-regional Pokémon in
tall grass
. For it to work, you need to be standing in tall grass without being mounted on your
bicycle
. After one use, it takes 50 steps to recharge.
Pokémon Swarms
Once you have the National Pokédex, a swarm of Pokémon from a different region will appear on a different Route each day. The house south of Professor Rowan's lab belongs to
Lucas
/
Dawn
. Their little sister can tell you which of the swarm Pokémon is currently present.

Dongle method
Main article:
Dual-slot mode
By playing your Platinum game with a
Generation III
cartridge inserted in your Nintendo DS or DS Lite's GBA slot, you can make certain Pokémon appear on certain routes and areas throughout Sinnoh. Most of the Pokémon that appear depend on which GBA game is inserted, but
Haunter
and
Gengar
will appear in the
Old Chateau
if you insert any Generation III game.
Eterna City
Professor Oak is in the house next to the Gym in the southern part of town. Talk to him and he will give you an
Up-Grade
and mention that Kanto's
Legendary birds
Zapdos
,
Articuno
, and
Moltres
are now
roaming
around Sinnoh.

If you want to catch a lot of rare Pokémon, you should visit the
Great Marsh
at the north end of
Pastoria City
. For
$
500 you can explore the Marsh until you throw 30
Safari Balls
or walk 500 steps, whichever comes first. You won't use your Pokémon to battle here - if a wild Pokémon appears, you can throw Mud, Bait, or a
Safari Ball
. Bait lowers the chance of the Pokémon escaping, has a 90% chance of lowering its
catch rate
. The mud does just the opposite, making the Pokémon easier to catch, has a 90% probability of causing its chances of fleeing to rise.
For
$
100, you can look through the binoculars in the upstairs room of the entrance building before a Safari Game. They show wild Pokémon in the Marsh area where they can be found. This is useful for spotting the rare Pokémon that are randomly selected each day.
