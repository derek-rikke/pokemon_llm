When you go to
Iron Island
, you might want a
party
that only contains five Pokémon, because you can receive a
Pokémon Egg
toward the end of the maze. Use the
Dowsing Machine
on your
Pokétch
to find a hidden
Star Piece
that you can exchange at
Fuego Ironworks
for colored
shards
. Interior
Star Pieces
will regenerate each day.
At the entrance to the mine you'll meet a man named
Riley
, who will give you
HM04
(
Strength
). He mentions he is training inside and proposes you join him. While receiving the HM is the only required part of your mission here, you'll find some good items, get valuable training, and
an extremely rare Pokémon
if you explore the whole mine.

In the west side of B1F there are just two items and a single Trainer. One of these items is the
Protector
which can evolve
Rhydon
into
Rhyperior
if it is held while traded. Afterwards, return to 1F and this time use the right-hand stairs to reach the east side of B1F.
On the right-hand side of B1F, you will again face one Trainer and find some more items, including another hidden Star Piece. Make sure to keep an eye on your bearings here since it is easy to get lost in this maze. You need to stay on the correct path to find the items and get to the small elevator that will take you down to B2F. Once again, there are two pathways. Since Riley can be found by taking the left stairs, let's go right first so afterwards Riley can heal your team.

In B2F's east side you will face two Trainers, and also find
TM23
(
Iron Tail
). If you follow the path that leads to the other side of where the TM was found and use your Dowsing Machine, you will find yet another hidden Star Piece.
Once you reach the left side of B2F, Riley will team up with you to investigate the mystery of a disturbance here in the mine. Just like
Cheryl
and
Mira
, he will heal your team after every battle, and double battles will also occur in the wild. Therefore, you should train as much as possible while he is with you.

Remember, like all
Multi Battle
situations, two wild Pokémon will appear at once and you can't catch a wild Pokémon unless you knock the other out. Since the Trainers in this room are positioned to where you could face them in a
Double Battle
, do not waste the opportunity to do so, if you wish.
Just like B1F's east room, B2F's west room is also a maze so make sure to get your bearings for collecting items or facing Trainers. Your final target is the pair of
Galactic Grunts
in the south area of the room - be warned, Riley will leave after you face them. After defeating
Workers
Brendon and Quentin head southwest and follow the path to reach a ledge above them and then use the Dowsing Machine to find a fourth hidden Star Piece. Also in the southeastern area down some small stairs, the Dowsing Machine will reveal a hidden item, the
Iron Plate
.
After getting past the somewhat tricky
Ace Trainer
duo Jonah and Brenda, you'll find the Galactic Grunts - the disturbance in the cave.

After you defeat the grunts, Riley will thank you for your help and will give you a Pokémon Egg containing
Riolu
,
Lucario
's pre-evolution. As long as you remembered to only bring five Pokémon with you, there should be no problem; if not, you'll have to return to Canalave City first to empty a slot in your team and then backtrack to get the Egg.
All that's left is taking the elevator down and entering the final room.

do
have the event Regigigas, you won't be able to

Leave Iron Island and return to Canalave City to earn your

Canalave Gym
Canalave Gym 1F
Canalave Gym 2F
Canalave Gym 3F
Canalave Gym 4F
Be aware that the toughest Pokémon you'll face here is Level 41. The layout of the
Canalave Gym
is a maze consisting of multiple elevator platforms. As you may already know, it specializes in
Steel-types
. You'll want
Fire
-,
Ground
-, and/or
Fighting
-type attacks on your Pokémon. Many of the Pokémon in this gym are part Ground or
Rock
, so
Water-type
attacks (such as
Surf
) are also useful. Steel-types
resist
attacks of almost every other type, and are completely immune to
Poison-type
moves. Also, most of the Pokémon in this Gym have high
Defense
, so
Special moves
will do the most damage to them.
To deal with the maze, first head to the easternmost elevator out of the set of four you'll find on 1F. Then, take the elevator south of you on 2F to reach the southeast area of 1F. The next one will take you back up to 2F. Then, use the moving lift hooked up to a wire to get across the ledge. Take the regular elevator there to reach 3F, where you will find more moving lifts to take you across the wires. First, use the moving lift north of you to reach the north area of 3F with two moving lifts side-by side. Take the northern lift and then keep following the path that will take you back down to 2F. Another elevator will take you to the northern area of the 1F. There, an elevator with a red outline will take you up to 4F where
Byron

is.

Byron starts by sending out
Magneton
, whose weak Sp. Defense makes it vulnerable to moves like
Fire Blast
. Also, a
Ground-type
move like
Earthquake
could easily take it out in one hit due to its Steel/
Electric
typing. Beware of
Flash Cannon
if your Earthquake user is part
Rock-type
.
Metal Sound
will harshly lower your Pokémon's Special Defense, causing
Thunderbolt
,
Tri Attack
, and Flash Cannon to do even more damage, so be careful. It's best to use Special attacks on Byron's
Steelix
because of its high Defense stat. It will dispose of Fire-types with Earthquake unless you have a Fire-type strong and fast enough to take it out in one hit. Ground Pokémon, on the other hand, must watch out for
Ice Fang
. Don't worry too much about Steelix's Flash Cannon, as its Special Attack isn't the best. The last Pokémon you'll face is
Bastiodon
, which is high-leveled but can easily be defeated by a powerful Fighting- or Ground-type attack due to it's type combo of Rock/Steel. Be sure to take it out in one hit (which isn't too hard), or your Pokémon will be on the receiving end of
Metal Burst
, which does 1.5 times the damage your previous attack did to Bastiodon.
Stone Edge
poses a threat to Fire-types, and
Iron Defense
will sharply raise Bastiodon's already high Defense stat.
Taunt
will only allow your Pokémon to use attacking moves, which shouldn't be much of a concern. Get Bastiodon out of your way as quickly as possible, and you'll have saved your team some pain and earned yourself the
Mine Badge
without too much trouble!
Once you defeat Byron, he will give you the Mine Badge, which causes all traded Pokémon up to Level 70 obey you without question and allows for
Strength
to be used outside of battle. He'll also give you
TM91
(
Flash Cannon
), a Steel-type Special attack that occasionally lowers the enemy's Special Defense stat.
When you step out the door, your rival
Barry
will be there waiting for you. After congratulating you on getting the Mine Badge, he asks you to come with him to the Canalave Library. You can meet them there, but he will stop you if you haven't been to Iron Island to pick up
HM04
(
Strength
).
Canalave City
Head to Canalave Library where your rival is still waiting. Speak to him there, then head in the building and go up to the 3F. It turns out that
Professor Rowan
is there with his assistant
Lucas
/
Dawn
and wanted you to be part of this conversation. Rowan explains that during his exploration of Pokémon evolution, he learned of the
Lake guardians
that might shed some light on the mystery of evolution he is trying to solve. He is therefore going to investigate the lakes where these three guardians live, and while he is going with his assistant to
Lake Verity
, you will go to
Lake Valor
, and Barry is going to
Lake Acuity
. Just then a tremor goes off, and you'll learn there was an explosion at Lake Valor, and so the group then separates to head to each of their destinations. You can go to yours immediately, but some extra training at
Iron Island
, as your rival suggests, may be helpful. Additionally, since you now have six badges and can use
Strength
, you can backtrack for items you couldn't get before in places such as the basement at
Oreburgh Gate
.
Oreburgh Gate (optional)
Now that you can use
Strength
, you can pick up a few items that were not accessible before.

Saturn's Golbat can easily be knocked out with an
Electric
or
Rock-type
move. His Bronzor should be no problem with a Fire-type special move just like in the Canalave Gym. His star Pokémon is a
Toxicroak
. It takes a 4× weakness to a
Psychic-type
. If you do use a Psychic-type make sure it is gifted in
Speed
, like
Espeon
or
Kadabra
, since a slower Psychic-type may have trouble with Toxicroak's
Faint Attack
, a
Dark-type
move. Toxicroak is also weak to
Ground
and
Flying
.
After the battle Saturn will gloat how pointless it is to stand up to Team Galactic and mentions that Commander Mars should have caught the guardian at Lake Verity by now before leaving. It is time to head to Lake Verity, so make sure to have your team ready before flying back to
Twinleaf Town
and then heading to Lake Verity.
