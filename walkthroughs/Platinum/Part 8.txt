Route 215
is packed with Trainers and items, and the constant
rainfall
boosts the power of
Water-type
moves by 50% (and decreases the power of
Fire-type
moves by 50%), so this is a good place to train Water-type Pokémon. Bring a Pokémon that knows
Cut
- it will make travel significantly easier and will allow you to collect all the items on your way to
Veilstone City
. Head east a short distance, then circle around anticlockwise up and across the first bridge. Follow the path until you reach the third bridge, make a detour to fight the
Black Belt
to its south, then Cut your way through to another Black Belt to collect the
Fist Plate
and jump over the ledge. Use Cut on the tree below the next hill to harvest some Berries, then head up the hill, detour south across the fourth and final bridge. Follow the path onward collecting all the items that are of interest, making sure to Cut your way through to

Game Corner
The building in the southern part of the city decorated with glowing lights is the Game Corner. Here, you can collect Coins and then visit the Prize Exchange next door to get valuable items and
TMs
. Before you're allowed to play any games however, you'll need a
Coin Case
, in which your winnings are kept. Head to the next house to the west of the Game Corner. Speak to the clown inside, who'll hand over a Coin Case if you get the correct answer in his game of coin toss (you can play again whenever you get the wrong answer). In the Prize Exchange building to the east of the Game corner is a man who, if you talk to him while having a Pokémon with
Hidden Power
at the front of your party, will let you know what
type
Hidden Power
's damage will be.
Massage Lady
In the house next to the house where you find the Coin Case is the Massage Lady. She'll massage one of your Pokémon once per day and also find an
Accessory
, which also raises the Pokémon's
happiness
.
Veilstone Department Store
Veilstone has a
Department store
instead of a conventional Poké Mart. Take the opportunity to stock up on supplies!
Inside, there is a lady to the left of the entrance who will give you a
mask
to be put in the
Fashion Case
. The mask will match Lucas/Dawn's
first partner Pokémon
. The people at the counter on 1F sell items found in normal

Veilstone Gym
Veilstone Gym
After exploring Veilstone City, it's time for you to challenge the Gym for your fourth Badge. Before you enter the Gym, you'll encounter
Professor Rowan
's research assistant
Lucas
/
Dawn
, and both of you will then meet
Wake
,
Pastoria Gym
's leader, as he leaves the Gym. The Veilstone Gym Leader,
Maylene
, specializes in
Fighting
-type Pokémon, which are weak to
Psychic
- and
Flying
-type attacks, but Maylene's
Lucario
is also weak to Fighting-,
Fire
-, and
Ground
-type attacks. However, many Fighting-type Pokémon can learn
Rock
-type moves, which cover their weakness against Flying-type Pokémon, so a team with Psychic Pokémon and Ghost Pokémon is ideal here.
The Gym is a maze consisting of many punching bags that you must push to smash barriers made up of tires in order to open up new paths. Your key goal is to aim for the punching bag in the upper left of the Gym that destroys the barrier that will get you to Maylene.
Knock the first punching bag to the right, and head up through the (now vacant) gap between the bottom right boxing ring and the support pillar. Knock the next bag north, make a quick detour into the ring to battle the First Karate Quad, then knock the bag north once more - it should end up just above and to the right of another bag. Knock this bag north, then follow it and head up and around the stack of tires at the northeast corner of the northeast boxing ring. Knock the next bag (that is just north of the northeast ring) twice to the left, then head south between the northeast ring and the benches, stopping to battle the second and third members of the Karate Quad, then head into the western portion of the Gym.
Head northwest, fight the fourth and final member of the Karate Quad, then knock the bag next to him south once, and then once east. Next, find the bag directly south of the path between the benches and north of the southwest boxing ring. Knock this bag anticlockwise (up, left, down, then right) all the way back to its original position. This should clear the way to the southwestern-most punching bag, which can now be knocked north once and east. Head up between the benches, and knock the bag above them twice to the east, finally opening up the stairs to allow you to challenge Maylene!

Maylene leads with her Meditite, which can use
Fake Out
on its first turn in battle to force your Pokémon to flinch and deal some damage. A quick
Flying-type
like
Staravia
using
Wing Attack
or
Aerial Ace
will take it out before it can use Rock Tomb to counter your
Flying-type
-type, but a
Ghost-type
is ideal as it will take little damage from Meditite's moves. Her Machoke is more offensive but should not be too difficult to beat though it can also counter Flying types with Rock Tomb, a
Psychic
or Ghost Pokémon will do will here too. Last up is Lucario, Maylene's star Pokémon. It has a variety of attacks, but nothing too rough. Its
Steel-type
makes it only take regular damage from Flying and Psychic but adds weaknesses to
Fire
,
Fighting
, and
Ground
. Two of them are conveniently exploited by attacks sold at the Department Store, but Lucario can counter
Fire-type
-types with
Bone Rush
. Be careful of her Gym's signature move
Drain Punch
, which heals her Pokémon by 50% of the damage dealt with it, so try not to get into a war of attrition. Maylene will use Hyper Potions when her Pokémon get weak, so try to finish them off without dropping their HP to below 20% (when the HP bar turns red).
After you defeat her, she'll hand over the Cobble Badge, explaining that it'll allow you use
HM02
(
Fly
) outside of battle, and that traded Pokémon up to level 50 will obey you without question, along with
TM60
(
Drain Punch
).
Veilstone City
As you leave the Gym,
Professor Rowan

Upon defeat, the grunts give back the Pokédex and flee.
Looker
then shows up, having heard of the robbery, and is glad you were able to handle the situation. After your partner leaves, Looker guides you into the warehouse. Inside he finds that the door is locked and states there is nothing he can do now. He does find
HM02
(
Fly
) however, which you should pick up. Before leaving, Looker mentions a rumor of Team Galactic moving something important to
Pastoria City
. There's nothing else of importance to do in Veilstone (for now), so it's time to head south to Pastoria, after healing up at the Pokémon Center if necessary. To get to Pastoria, you must enter the east gate through
Route 214
