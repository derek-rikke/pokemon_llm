Snowpoint City
Once in Snowpoint City, talk to the
Sailor
to board the ship to the
Battle Zone
. Before you go,
Cynthia
will appear and give you a pep talk about how people must work together to help change the world so no one ends up like
Cyrus
. She wants you to go the Battle Zone to learn and grow. After you speak with her, the ship will depart for the
Fight Area
.

When you arrive,
Barry
will be there and drag you to the front of the
Battle Frontier
. It turns out that
Flint
and
Volkner
are preventing him from entering, believing he may not be strong enough. Once you accept Barry's offer for a
Multi Battle
, the two of you will automatically engage the Trainers in a double battle. You can still reject the offer if you need to prepare your team.

Do not underestimate Flint and Volkner's team as they can be deadly if you get careless. They have
Houndoom
,
Luxray
, the
Eeveelutions
Flareon
and
Jolteon
, and their star Pokémon
Magmortar
and
Electivire
. A
Rock
/
Ground
combo like
Golem
can help, but their Magmortar has
SolarBeam
to dispose of it. As long as you plan ahead and work together with Barry, you'll be fine if your team is at the right levels.
After the two leave, you'll meet Barry's father
Palmer
, one of the
Frontier Brains
. He'll explain how each facility has its own rules before he leaves. Barry explains that his father is the reason he decided to become a Trainer. You'll then meet a boy named
Buck
who was impressed with your recent battle. He that mentions he usually trains at the
Survival Area
or
Stark Mountain
.
Go near the Fight Area's north exit to talk to a
Fisherman
who will give you the
Super Rod
, the best fishing rod in the game, which will help you obtain some non-regional Water-type Pokémon. After that, go north to
Route 225
.
(You will need the HMs
Cut
, Surf, and Rock Climb.)
At this point, thanks to your trip to the Battle Zone and Fullmoon Island, you can now explore any area of the
Underground
. Additionally, you can now mine the
Fossils
from
Generation I
and
Generation III
. Like the Generation IV Fossils, they need to be taken to the
Oreburgh Museum
to be revived.

For this Route it should be pretty straightforward. For getting to the Berry patch and some of the items you will need
Cut
,
Surf
, and
Rock Climb
. Fortunately none of the HM moves are necessary for progressing through this route to reach the
Survival Area
. Notably around the only house in this area is the
Lax Incense
, the only Incense that cannot be collected during the main game which you will need Cut to get to. Other items on this route include evolution items, though pretty much all you them have been found earlier in the game and all you can do is get extra copies of them.

Stark Mountain
. If you use the ledges near the west side or the small path on the east, you'll reach the house located in the south of town. Inside is a man that will give you
TM42
(
Facade
).
Move Tutor
The house on the cliff has the final Move Tutor in the game. To access it go east to
Route 226
and use the first Rock Climb ledge you see to go up there. Like the previous Tutors you will need colored shards to be able to teach your Pokémon moves they are compatible with.

For this route you will need Rock Climb and Surf. For the first part go to the Rock Climb ledge to the far right climb up it. The trick to getting to the berry patch and the items is by carefully observing which Rock Climb ledge goes to where. To make it easy go to the ledge to the right that leads down. Then go to the nearby ledge that leads up. Now go to the ledge near the two trainers that leads down (though go the ledge after facing those trainers to find
TM53
(
Energy Ball
), a useful move). Now you can get to the second part where Surf is needed.
In the second area you will find a house belonging to a man called the Meister who is German in origin. He will perform an upgrade that will store Pokédex entries from Pokémon games from other countries. He will also trade you a
Magikarp
from Germany in exchange for
Finneon
. To the east of his house is a grassland area that leads to
Route 227
and
Route 228
. Head for the north exit that leads to Route 227 first.

As you notice when you arrive here is volcanic ash in the air, as you are close to
Stark Mountain
, which is an active volcano. Carefully jump over the two bike ledges with the bike and after the second ledge jump over the regular ledge once, but careful not to jump over the second one to a avoid backtracking. After that you will see
Barry
and
Wake
, and after Wake acknowledges your growing strength, Barry annoys Wake again by calling him master despite not being made Wake's apprentice and Barry pleads that he needs him to enter the Battlefield club. Wake will point out how prepared your team must be for dealing with Stark Mountain before he leaves with Barry right behind him.
The lady in the nearby house will let your team rest when you talk to her. Follow the path and you'll encounter
Buck
again. He asks you to go up to Stark Mountain to patrol it and guard the Magma Stone which keeps a
certain
Pokémon asleep and that a group of vandals that dress like
spacemen
have been plaguing the area lately. Buck mentions he can't go as his Pokémon are low on HP. Continue following the path and you will reach Stark Mountain.
