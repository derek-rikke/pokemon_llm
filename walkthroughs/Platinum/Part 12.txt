Fly
to
Sandgem Town
and use the south exit to reach
Route 219
. It is the first of a chain of routes that you can use to reach Sinnoh's
Pal Park
. The Pal Park will be inaccessible until you have the National Pokédex, but the training you'll get on the way there is valuable, and the Pal Park can be flown to after you visit it once. You'll want to bring
Grass
- and/or
Electric
-types for the trip since the Trainers on the upcoming Routes use mostly
Water-types
.

Though not as simple as Route 219,
Route 220
is pretty straightforward. Head down the eastern side when the route forks in two, fight the
Swimmer
there, then backtrack and head down the western fork. A little further on, the way forward forks in two again, this time around a largish island. Grab the
Max Repel
just north of it, then head down the southern fork until you reach the island with the submerged shoreline. Continue east past the
Carbos
, making a quick detour into route 221 to fight the female Swimmer, then backtrack and head north where the Carbos is, head west briefly to fight the male Swimmer, then go east to
Route 221
.

Continue east from Route 220. Fight the male Swimmer, and continue east until you reach land. Head east on the northern section Route 221, stopping at the Level House (see below) to pick up the
Pure Incense
which allows you to produce a
Chingling
Egg when breeding
Chimecho
. When you reach the Pal Park (inaccessible until after you defeat the Elite Four), head back along the southern part of the route, collecting all the items you missed when travelling on the northern part. Now that you're finished here, it's time to Fly back to
Jubilife City
and head northwest via
Route 218
to reach
Canalave City
.
Level House
The only house located on Route 221 belongs to an old man who will each ask for a Pokémon at a certain random
level
from 1 to 100 each day. The items he'll give you are the
Black Belt
,
Expert Belt
, or
Focus Sash
. Only one item is given to you out of that particular order when you complete his request, and after he gives you the Focus Sash, the cycle will start over.
For days where the requirement is an extremely high-leveled Pokémon, you can try
soft resetting
and not much else. On some days you might get lucky and be able to use Pokémon from your regular team. For days where low-level Pokémon are needed, the quickest solution is to simply head to an earlier area with an
Quick Ball
or two, catch a Pokémon of the appropriate level, and bring it to him.

Now that you have
Surf
, you're able to navigate the rest of Route 218 and reach
Canalave City
, your next destination. There isn't much to do on this short route except for fighting the Trainers and catch
Mr. Mime
(this is the only location in Sinnoh where they can be found).
When you enter the
guard post
separating Route 218 from Canalave City,
Professor Rowan
's assistant will approach and give you upgrade to your
Pokédex
. This will allow you to check the differences in appearance between the same Pokémon in their Pokédex entry, such as
gender
or
form
differences.

Barry now has a
Heracross
on his team, but a powerful
Flying-type
move can easily beat it. Unless you have an especially fast one, avoid using
Psychic-type
-types as Heracross's
Dark-type
move
Night Slash
will counter it. Four members of Barry's team have reached their highest evolutionary form, but they shouldn't be too much of a problem as long as your party is at least at Level 35 and has good type coverage. After the battle, Barry will suggest that the player visit
Iron Island
before heading off towards the library.
The
Move Deleter
resides in the house just north of the
Poké Mart
. He will be able to remove any unwanted moves in your Pokémon's present moveset including
HM
moves. This is the only way for a Pokémon to forget a HM.
The southernmost house on the west side of town belongs to a
Sailor
named
Eldritch
, who handles the ferry in town. Nothing important will happen here until the post-game after obtaining the
National Pokédex
. Eldritch is waiting near his boat at the dock nearby, and he can take you to Iron Island which will be required to visit. South from the wharf is a hidden area where you can pick up the
TM89
(
U-turn
).
