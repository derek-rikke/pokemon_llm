After returning to
Sendoff Spring
in the regular world, Cynthia suggests that you visit
Sandgem Town
since
Professor Rowan
was worried about you. If you don’t have
Fly
with you, go south to
Spring Path
and you'll find yourself on
Route 214
where there were previously only trees. From there, head to
Veilstone City
to get the Pokémon you need before Flying off to Sandgem Town.
Sandgem Town
When you arrive at Professor Rowan's lab in
Sandgem Town
, it turns out both he and
Lucas
/
Dawn
are relieved to see you alive, as they had been trying to find you. Professor Rowan will mention that the Lake Guardians have returned to their homes. Seeing the number of Pokémon you have, and your seven Badges, he suggests that you head to
Sunyshore City
where the final Gym is and eventually challenge the
Elite Four
to broaden your horizons.
You are now free to continue east through
Valor Lakefront
to access
Route 222
and Sunyshore City, but let's visit the Lake Guardians first, as they need to be encountered for you to get the
National Pokédex
.
Mt. Coronet (optional)

Team Galactic
is gone, a few items in
Mt. Coronet

Catching the Lake Guardians
To get the National
Pokédex
, you only need to see the Lake Guardians. If you still want to catch them, then your Pokémon should be at reasonably high Levels, as the Lake Guardians are at Level 50. It's recommended you bring a
Steel-type
with you to resist the Lake Guardians' attacks, as well as
False Swipe
or a
sleep
-inducing move to make them easier to catch. To catch
Azelf
and
Uxie
, you should bring about 40
Dusk Balls
or
Timer Balls
. (Timer Balls become more effective than Dusk Balls after 25 turns) Also, you'll need the HM
Surf
to get across each lake. As always,
SAVING
before encountering them is a good idea.

TM38
(
Fire Blast
)
In the south-west corner of the western patch of grass (requires
Surf
)
Pt
When you arrive at
Lake Verity
, Surf over to the southwestern corner of the lake to find
TM38
(
Fire Blast
). After that, Surf to the cavern in the center and talk to
Mesprit
inside. It quickly leaves, but is counted as seen in your Pokédex. Professor Rowan shows up and after you listen to him babble about his research, he mentions that Mesprit is likely playing with you and you'll need to track it with the
Marking Map
app on your Pokétch, which can track roaming Pokémon. If you didn't get it yet, Fly to
Jubilife City
and go to the
Pokétch Company
building. Talk to the company President inside. This is the second app you'll receive from him anytime after collecting your third Badge.
Mesprit
roams
Sinnoh, moving every time you enter a different town or Route. On the first turn of battle, it will flee. This mission will take either patience or a
Master Ball
. As long as your lead Pokémon is at or below level 50,
Repels
can make it easier to find in the grass.
Jubilife City is a good place to use for moving between Routes to draw Mesprit closer, as it has four different exits. The
guardpost
leading to
Route 218
or the cave that leads to the upper area of
Route 204
are helpful if Mesprit makes it to those places and you are in the right position, since moving through them does not count as changing locations. You can also try moving back and forth across a boundary between two routes until Mesprit appears on your route.

One method to catch it without a Master Ball is to
Paralyze
Mesprit or put it to
sleep
with a faster Pokémon the first time you encounter it. On subsequent encounters, attack it to carefully cut down its HP and soft-reset in case you knock it out. Once you've had enough battles to cut its HP bar down to the red zone, throw
Quick Balls
each time you see it until you catch it.
The second strategy is to use the escape-preventing moves
Block
or
Mean Look
, then continue into a battle similar to the one when you caught Giratina. Once you have it trapped, throw Dusk Balls (if it is nighttime) or Timer Balls to catch it. Out of the three Lake Guardians, Mesprit is the slowest, but it has better HP and more balanced offensive and defensive stats compared to Azelf and Uxie.

Azelf
is the fastest Lake Guardian and has the best offensive stats compared to the others, but it has the weakest defenses. With
Nasty Plot
, it can quickly become a serious threat by boosting its Special Attack.
Steel-types
are good Pokémon to use because they resist Azelf's attacks. Paralyze it or put it to
sleep
, then carefully weaken it with a not-too-powerful move. Once its HP is in the red zone, keep throwing Dusk Balls until you catch it.

Uxie in terms of base stats is the opposite of Azelf, where it is the strongest in its defensive stats and weakest in its offensive stats. It can use
Amnesia
to raise its Sp. Defense stat by 2 levels. Use non-supereffective physical moves to lower its HP and then use False Swipe if necessary. Uxie may try to put your Pokémon to sleep with
Yawn
which can be an annoyance until Uxie's HP is in the red zone and you can focus on catching it. Just like with Azelf, Dusk Balls are the best way to go, though Timer Balls may be needed as backup.
Now that you have dealt with the Lake Guardians, Fly back to
Pastoria City
, then head to
Hotel Grand Lake
at Valor Lakefront. Time to travel east to your final Gym battle!

Route 222
is the path from
Valor Lakefront
to
Sunyshore City
. It's worth noting that it's also the only location where you can find a wild
Electabuzz
. The two houses on the beach are not essential to visit, but the one on the left is a
Pikachu
fan club. One of the Pikachu inside is actually a
Poké Kid
who will battle the player using two Pikachu of her own! The other house has a Fisherman inside who is looking for a giant
Remoraid
that is larger than 23.7 inches. If you show him one then he'll give you a
Net Ball
.
Also on this route is the final
Honey Tree
you'll find in the game. The man at the end of the cliff will give you
TM56
(
Fling
). If you ever use Fling in battle, be aware that usually
the user's held item will be lost forever
upon use (some places where it's kept include the
Battle Frontier
and player-versus-player battles). Make sure to battle the
Fishermen
on the beach, as one of them has a
Feebas
, which is a hard to spot Pokémon that you will need to see to complete your
Sinnoh
Pokédex
. Once you are done here, head through the gatehouse to reach Sunyshore City.

Julia's House
The right-hand house in the northeastern corner of the city belongs to a woman named Julia. Visit her daily to obtain a
Ribbon
. The Ribbon you receive is dependent on which day of the week it is. She does not give out a ribbon on the first visit.
Vista Lighthouse
The large building in the southeastern corner of the city is the
Vista Lighthouse
. First, use the
Dowsing Machine
to find a hidden
Zap Plate
here. Inside, talk to Volkner and you'll leave him convinced to accept your challenge at the Gym.
