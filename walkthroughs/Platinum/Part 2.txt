After the demonstration on how to catch a Pokémon,
Dawn
/
Lucas
will give you 5
Poké Balls
to get you started. Go further along the route, it's pretty straightforward. You can use the ledges to escape the grass if you need to heal, and after fighting through 3
Trainers
, keep going west to find a
Potion
in a patch of grass. After this, head north to reach
Jubilife City
.

Upon entrance to
Jubilife City
, you will notice that it is a much larger town than either
Twinleaf
or Sandgem. As soon as you walk into Jubilife City, Dawn/Lucas will come up to you and talk to you for a while. Dawn/Lucas will then take you up the main street for a while, until you see
Looker
hiding behind a lamp post between the
Pokémon Center
and the Trainer's School. Looker will then talk to you for a short time. After that he will give you the
Vs. Recorder
and be on his way. Head west to the Trainer's School.
Trainer's School
Inside the school will be your rival! Go talk to him and deliver the parcel from his mom. Your rival notices that there are two town maps, so he gives you one of them. Your rival leaves promptly after this. Inside the school, you can study the blackboard to learn about
status conditions
, or you can battle the two Trainers in the northeast corner of the room. There is also an
X Attack
hidden among some of the books on the west side.
Pokétch Campaign
Once you leave the Trainer's School and start heading north, a man will interrupt you and tell you about a promotion for the
Pokétch
. If you find the three clowns and receive all the coupons, you will be given a free Pokétch!
Clown 1
Can be found in the area of the
Poké Mart
.
Question: "Does a Pokémon grow by defeating others and gaining EXP Points?"
The answer to this clown's question is "Yes".
Clown 2
This one is standing in front of the Pokétch Company in the northwest corner of town.
Question: "Just like Pokémon types, do the moves also have types?"
The answer to this clown's question is "Yes".
Clown 3
This clown is blocking the entrance to the
Jubilife TV
station.
Question: "Can a Pokémon hold an item?"
The answer to this clown's question is "Yes".
Jubilife Condominiums
You can find the Jubilife Condominiums to the northeast. The girl on the ground floor gives you a
Quick Claw
. Talk to the other NPCs if you want to hear about the Pokétch, moves, and
Heal Balls
, which are available at the Jubilife PokéMart across the street.
Next, it is a good idea to head west to
Route 218
to obtain the
Old Rod
from a
Fisherman
. That's the only thing you'll find there for now, until you can use
Surf
. After you have obtained the coupons, return to the man and receive your Pokétch. After you are finished exploring Jubilife City, your next destination is
Route 203
.
Be prepared for a rival battle, though, so heal up your Pokémon at the
Pokémon Center
before continuing and train if necessary.
Route 203
Route 203
After leaving
Jubilife City
, you will quickly be challenged by your rival.

Afterwards you can travel along
Route 203
, battling Trainers and picking up items. This route is notably the only place where you can catch a
level
7
Bidoof
before using
Rock Smash
. Once this Bidoof reaches level 15 and
evolves
, it can learn any four of the six
HM
moves required to reach any location in this game. You can then leave it at level 15 so that more experience goes to the Pokémon that do not need to know weak HM moves, such as Rock Smash,
Cut
, or
Rock Climb
.

Route 207
to find some new wild Pokémon.
In one of the houses here, there is a woman, Hilary, who will
trade
you her
Abra
, nicknamed Kazza, in exchange for a Machop, which you can catch on
Route 207
. Until you become able to use
another move
later in the game, Abra's
Teleport
will be very useful as transportation. Additionally, remember the
Oreburgh Mining Museum
, as it will be useful if you find
Fossils
later in the game.

After walking down the steps leading to the inside of
Oreburgh Mine
, you will enter a rectangular room. Upon reaching the large block of coal in the center of the room, turn right, and then walk south until you reach the end of the wall, at which point you should see a red-haired man in a mining helmet a few steps to your left. Talk to him, and he will introduce himself as
Roark
, the town's Gym Leader, and show you how to use Rock Smash. He then tells you that he will be back at the Gym, ready to challenge you. Exit the mine and head to the Gym.
