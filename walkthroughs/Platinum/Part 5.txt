Pt
When you meet Rad Rickshaw at his shop, he will give you a
bicycle
. You can ask him to read you the manual for the bike here once you receive one. A unique feature of this bicycle is that the player can press the B button to switch between the third and fourth gears. Fourth gear is faster than third gear and allows the player to ride up
muddy slopes
and jump further from bike
ramps
. Third gear can jump bike ramps, but does not jump as far. Head to Eterna City's south entrance - now that you have a bicycle, you're allowed onto Route 206, the
Cycling Road
.
Finally, before you leave, you might want to bring Pokémon which know

Now that you have
Cut
, you can visit the
Old Chateau
, which is located in the northern part of
Eterna Forest
, by the exit. Buy some
Nest Balls
from the Pokémart in Eterna City then backtrack to Eterna Forest, because the Old Chateau is home to
Rotom
. Since there are no in-game Trainers who use Rotom, you will need to face it here at some point for it to be counted as seen in your
Pokédex
. You'll find Gardenia near the entrance who, when you talk to her, appears too scared to go in due to the ghosts. Rotom aside, the Old Chateau is worth exploring to collect the items inside it. Go up the stairs to find the hallway with multiple small rooms. The only wild Pokémon you'll encounter here are
Gastly
, so you might want to bring some
Repels
to save yourself some annoyance.
From here, use the first door on your left to reach a room with a TV. During the night (8:00 PM to 3:59 AM), Rotom can be found here, hiding in the TV. Unlike in
Diamond and Pearl
, where you could only find it once the
National Dex
has been obtained, it can be found and captured right now.
Save your game
before trying to catch it.

Head upstairs and into the main hallway, and save the game before interacting with the TV which Rotom has possessed. Rotom is not very tough, so take care to whittle its health down with flying-, bug-, or poison-type moves. As Rotom is only level 20,
Nest Balls
will have the same catch rate as Ultra Balls in this encounter, so send it to
sleep
or
paralyze
it, then use your Nest Balls to catch it. If you got the
Dusk Ball
from
Oreburgh City
, then that will work even better than Nest Balls.

Exp. Share
when you talk to him, as long as have seen at 35 separate Pokémon; if you haven't yet, make sure to come back and get it when you have.
There are a number of Trainers to fight on the Cycling Road - defeat them all and exit through the southern gate, speaking to the woman in the gate on your way to get an accessory item. Enter the grassy area by using
Cut
on the tree to the right of the gate. A lone

Double Battles

Mira
in the cave who will serve as your tag battle partner. If you wish, you can find Mira before facing the Trainers to make these battles easier, since, like
Cheryl
earlier, she'll heal your team completely after each battle.
To get to Mira, use Flash, and, smashing your way through any rocks that pose an obstacle, go north through two 4-way intersections, west at the T-junction, north at the next turning, then east at another T-junction, and follow the passage continuing south through a 4-way intersection, following the passage to a final T-junction, where you should turn north to arrive at Mira in the north-eastern corner of the cave. Talk to Mira to have her accompany you.

Wayward Cave (Hidden Area)
To access the hidden area of Wayward Cave, start just south of the top right pillar that supports the Cycling Road, walk 9 steps west, and then go north until you reach the entrance. You won't need Flash here, except for the very small entry area, which you can find your way through easily. Notably, this is the only place in the game to contain wild
Gible
. You can also find the powerful
TM26
(
Earthquake
) here by traveling all the way through the path and going up the stairs to another hidden area on the 1F of Wayward Cave. You'll need your bike to jump the ramps; use 3rd gear (the slower gear) to land in the spot directly after a ramp, and 4th gear (the faster gear) to land 3 squares after a ramp.
When you've got everything you want from this area, head south to Route 207.
