Before you challenge the
Pokémon League
, use the Dowsing Machine app on your Pokétch near the base of the waterfall to find the
Sky Plate
. Now, use Surf and Waterfall to enter the building. Before going to the receptionist make sure to have a very good well-balanced team. Also make sure that all the members of your team are trained around Levels 54-58 to be able to stand a chance of succeeding. Also stock up on Hyper or Max Potions, Full Heals, Revives, and Full Restores. Just before you get to the receptionist in front of the door leading to the Elite Four, Barry will appear and challenge you to determine who among the two of you is more worthy.

The main new change is that Barry's
Munchlax
has evolved into a
Snorlax
, which should help count Snorlax as seen in the Sinnoh Pokédex. Snorlax can be easily brought down by a powerful
Fighting-type
attack such as
Cross Chop
or
Close Combat
. Other than that the same weaknesses as before can be used to defeat the other members of his team. Afterwards Barry will leave convinced he is not ready yet if he keeps losing like this, but vows to be the one to defeat you.
Talk to the Ace Trainer and once he confirms you have the eight Sinnoh Badges you can then face the Elite Four, but just remember that if you lose after passing through the doorway, you must start over.

The first member of the Elite Four is Aaron, who specialises in
Bug-types
. Aaron's
Yanmega
can heighten its evasiveness with
Double Team
and its speed through its ability,
Speed Boost
. Take it down before it becomes a problem.
Aerial Ace
or
Shock Wave
can help if it gets too hectic. Both
Heracross
and
Vespiquen
know
Rock
attacks that threaten
Flying-types
, but a powerful Flying-type move can easily bring them down. For
Scizor
, a
Fire-type
would be best. For
Drapion
, his strongest Pokémon, you can use a
Ground-type
to target its one weakness (though it does have
Ice Fang
to counter Ground-types) or use a
Steel-type
that resists its moves.

For dealing with Bertha's team if you have a
fast
Grass
or
Water-type
, then you should have an easy time.
Whiscash
has a 4× weakness to Grass-types,
Golem
,
Rhyperior
have a 4× weakness to Grass and Water-types, and
Gliscor
has a 4× weakness to
Ice-types
. Exploit these weaknesses with attacks such as
Ice Beam
or
Surf
. Hit
Hippowdon
, her only single type Pokémon, with powerful attacks before it can hit back. While Gliscor, Golem, and Rhyperior know moves to cover several of their weaknesses, their low Special Defense can still be exploited.

Flint will thank you for helping
Volkner
earlier and then face you in a battle. Be careful when his Pokémon use
Sunny Day
, as it can raise their Fire-type moves and weaken the power of Water-type moves. His first Pokémon
Houndoom
should be taken down as quick as possible to help give you an early lead before Sunny Day is used.
Flareon
should not be much of a problem, though be careful with
Overheat
since it is very powerful when first used. Also, its
Will-O-Wisp
can induce a burn, which can easily halt sweeps.
Rapidash
's speed can be a hassle, and its
Solar Beam
can cover its weaknesses, especially in
harsh sunlight
.
Infernape
is weak to
Water
,
Ground
,
Flying
, and
Psychic
, but it can cover Water- and Flying-types with
Thunder Punch
. His strongest Pokémon
Magmortar
has a pretty strong moveset and
Special Attack
, but a faster Pokémon with a strong Water, Rock, or Ground-type move could easily take it out. However, be careful not to use physical/contact moves, as
Flame Body
may burn your sweeper. Ground Pokémon such as
Garchomp
are especially useful in this fight.

Mr. Mime
can
Reflect
or
Light Screen
to halve out the power of your moves, so it's advised to take it out quickly.
Espeon
and
Alakazam
have low physical
Defense
, but they are fast and know attacks that are strong against
Dark
.
Bronzong
has high Defenses and is only weak to
Fire
. While it can use
Earthquake
to cover Fire-types, its slow speed makes it easy to bring down by a powerful Fire-type Attack.
Gallade
is weak to only
Flying
- and
Ghost-type
attacks. Be careful when using Flying-types as it can counter them with Stone Edge. A powerful Pokémon like
Staraptor
can easily beat it with
Brave Bird
.

Cynthia will thank you for your help on Mt. Coronet and in the Distortion World earlier before facing you. Cynthia does not follow a specific type so this battle will be trouble if you don't plan ahead.
Spiritomb
has no direct weaknesses. However, it is weak offensively, so powerful attackers can bring it down.
Roserade
shouldn't be that much of a hassle if you get it down quick with Fire or Flying types. It would be recommended to use an
Electric-type
against
Milotic
since it has Ice Beam to counter Grass-types. Physical attacks, like
ThunderPunch
or
Wood Hammer
, tend to work better because they make
Mirror Coat
fail.
Use Fire, Ground, or Fighting-type moves to bring down
Lucario
.
Togekiss
can be brought down by an Electric-type but be careful of its high defenses.
Garchomp
, the Champion's strongest Pokémon, is far more dangerous than anything you have battled. It may have a 4× weakness to Ice-types, but its high physical
Attack
and Speed often lets Garchomp one-shot your Pokémon before you can move. If you can get it to use
Giga Impact
, then exploit the free turn while you have the chance.
After the battle Cynthia will praise you on the conviction you have with your Pokémon to become Champion. She'll then take you to the Hall of Fame where Professor Rowan will join you and all the Pokémon on your team are recorded into the Hall of Fame.
