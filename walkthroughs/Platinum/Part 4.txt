here who is guarding the door of

When you enter the Windworks, you will startle the grunt who had previously blocked the door. He quickly turns and runs away to warn
the Commander
. Follow him, battling the two grunts along the way. The Commander notices you and talks to you about Team Galactic, providing some information. She promptly challenges you to a battle.

The danger here is that Mars' Level 17
Purugly
is tough to beat unless if your team was well prepared beforehand. If you started with
Chimchar
, having it evolve into
Monferno
(at Lv. 14) to learn
Mach Punch
is useful.
Intimidate
users, such as
Staravia
or
Luxio
, are also helpful. Upon defeat, Mars will gather her grunts and leave the Windworks after
another Commander
reminds her that they've already collected enough energy from the Windworks for their plans.
The little girl's father thanks you for rescuing him, and his daughter runs in happily, thanking you as she passes. You now may continue north on Route 205, which was previously blocked by Galactic Grunts. After leaving the Windworks,
Looker
shows up and mentions that he heard of the attack on the Windworks and at first is in disbelief that you drove Team Galactic away. He then mentions that Team Galactic is rumored to have a
hideout
in
Eterna City
. Before continuing north, return to Floaroma Town and heal up your team.
Now that Team Galactic has left the Windworks, a
Drifloon
will appear here every Friday.

As stated before, the
Galactic Grunts
who were blocking you from entering
Route 205
are now gone with Commander Mars. You can cross the small bridge and then continue heading north until you get to Eterna Forest. Ascend to the raised western side of the route, and battle your way to the house at the top, where the woman inside can heal your Pokémon. Jump down the ledges on the eastern side of the route, battling all the trainers and collecting all the items on the lower level, then head left just before the last ledge and ascend back up to the top of the route and enter Eterna Forest.

Pt
Eterna Forest
has a reputation for being a mysterious place, from the abandoned
Old Chateau
to the strange Moss Rock. Eterna Forest is a long and complex structure of trees that make it a natural maze, where a lot of people get lost. It's home to many Bug- and Grass-type Pokémon, and is currently the only known place in Sinnoh to find and catch
Buneary
.
Once inside, a woman named
Cheryl
will ask you to escort her through the forest, since she is worried about being attacked by
Team Galactic
. When traveling with her, all wild encounters will become
Double Battles
! If you want to catch any of the Pokémon found here, it is recommended you do so after you've parted ways; while you're in Cheryl's company you're unable to catch wild Pokémon while there are two enemies on the field, and her Chansey will quickly finish off a single Pokémon. You also have the option of challenging pairs of Trainers as a tag team with Cheryl or by yourself by talking to them to fight individual battles. The greatest benefit of traveling with her is that after every battle, she will fully heal your team! This makes Eterna Forest a great place to train for your upcoming Gym Battle.

The most direct route from the southern exit to the northern exit is as follows: travel northeast from the entrance, through the
tall grass
, and then directly north, following the path between a Lass and a Bug Catcher. Then, continue east a short way to the trees and then south to a large patch of tall grass. From there, continue east until the eastern wall is reached. A considerable distance north of there is the exit, around a small rock ledge. However, you may (and should) choose to deviate from this route, as there are a lot of items and Trainers to be found in Eterna Forest. Once you reach the northern exit, Cheryl will leave. Upon leaving, Cheryl will give you the Soothe Bell as a gift.
Route 205 (east)
When you come out of Eterna Forest and return to
Route 205
, all you need to do is walk across the bridge. The
Fishermen
won't battle you unless you talk to them, so if you don't want the experience just go straight ahead to Eterna City.

Once in
Eterna City
, you will see that Team Galactic has set up another Headquarters. As usual, you'll be stopping them from their evil work. The building is blocked by small trees, though, so you must first go to the Gym, and battle the Gym Leader,
Gardenia
. Before that, go a bit ahead and
Barry
will accompany you to the statue around the corner. As you walk up to the statue, you'll see
Cyrus
there. Once again, he will make a reference to
Sinnoh's legends
.
After Barry and Cyrus leave, you'll find a hidden
Draco Plate
just behind the statue. As you head back the way you came, you'll meet
Cynthia
who gives you a copy of
HM01
(
Cut
)! Also, talk to the lady in the
Pokémon Center
for a
Pokétch
app called Friendship Checker which allows you to tell how much the Pokémon in your
Party
like you. This is useful when trying to evolve Pokémon that evolve with high
Friendship
.
Here are some other places you can check out in Eterna City:
Underground Man
Right next to the Pokémon Center is the house of the
Underground Man
, who will give you the
Explorer Kit
. You can use this daily to travel to the Sinnoh
Underground
, a vast expanse of tunnels where you can mine for items and create a
Secret Base
.
There are two potential types of fossils that can be mined in the Underground, but only one type is available per game. It has to do with the last digit of your
Trainer ID number
(visible on your
Trainer Card
). If the last digit is odd then you'll be able to obtain the Skull Fossil (
Cranidos
), but if it is even then you'll get the Armor Fossil (
Shieldon
). Fossils can be revived into their respective Pokémon in the
Oreburgh Mining Museum
. The Fossils from Generation I and III can only be obtained after getting the
National Pokédex
.
Eterna Condominiums

On the first floor of this building, Sinnoh's

can be found, as well as a boy named Norton who will trade a

Herb Shop
Main article:
Herb Shop
The
Herb Shop
is a shop that sells herbs with effects similar to other medicines. They're relatively inexpensive, but their bitter taste lowers the
Happiness
of Pokémon they are used on.
Revival Herbs
are probably the most useful thing that can be bought here.
Bike Shop
Main article:
Rad Rickshaw's Cycle Shop
Obviously, this is a store where
Bicycles
are sold. However, you can't purchase a bike from the store. The owner is being held captive by Team Galactic!
You can challenge the Eterna City Gym if you want but if you need more time to train or find new Pokémon you can check out the west side of
Route 211
and part of the north side of
Mt. Coronet
by heading through Eterna City's eastern exit. See
this section
for more details on Route 211 and
this section
for Mt. Coronet's North Area.
Eterna Gym
Interior of the Eterna Gym
This Gym specializes in
Grass-types
. Be aware that the highest-leveled Pokémon you'll encounter here is Level 22 and quite powerful.
Gardenia
's Grass-types are weak to
Fire
- and
Flying
-type moves. Avoid bringing
Ground
-,
Rock
-, and
Water
-types, as these types are very weak against her Grass Pokémon. If your starter was
Chimchar
, this should be an easy fight. If not, the common Pokémon
Starly
evolves into
Staravia
at Level 14, and is a good Flying-type that should be considered having on any team, regardless of your starter.
Once inside the Gym, you must find and battle three Trainers before Gardenia will face you. The hands of the giant clock in the middle move every time you defeat a Trainer. When they are pointing north, south, east, or west, you can walk across them to reach other areas of the Gym.

First she will send out her
Turtwig
, which will use moves like
Sunny Day
and
Reflect
to help set up the rest of her Pokémon. However, Sunny Day also powers up Fire-type moves, which you can use to your advantage. Gardenia's entire team knows
Grass Knot
, an attack that does more damage to
heavier Pokémon
. If Turtwig had a chance to set up Sunny Day, Gardenia's Cherrim will have its
Attack
and
Special Defense
increase by 50% due to
its Ability
. Try to knock it out quickly so you don't get hit by
Leech Seed
, which will drain your HP to heal the opponent. Gardenia's highest-leveled Pokémon,
Roserade
, has an additional
Poison
type that makes it weak to
Psychic-type
attacks. Along with the strong attack
Magical Leaf
, Roserade also has
Stun Spore
, a move that can
paralyze
, and
Poison Sting
, a weak attack that can
poison
your Pokémon.
Once you beat her you will receive the
Forest Badge
,
TM86
(
Grass Knot
), and the ability to use
Cut
outside of battle. Now, you may enter the Galactic Eterna Building.
