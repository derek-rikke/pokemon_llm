Apart from the Trainers,
Route 214
is a pretty straightforward route. First head south down the eastern side of the route. At the bottom of the maze of fences, head west a short distance, then back north up the mountainous western side of Route 214 where there are more trainers to battle, and, at the top, the
Maniac Tunnel
. On the way, collect the
Razor Fang

Gligar

long grass
near

Collect
TM28

Unown
at the
Solaceon Ruins
(you do not need to catch them, despite his claims), the Ruin Maniac lengthens the
Maniac Tunnel
and also raises the chance of encountering
Hippopotas
. By encountering all 26 alphabetical Unown, the tunnel will be complete, and you'll be able to collect the ! and ? Unown in the top floor of the Solaceon Ruins.
Solaceon Town (optional)
After encountering all 26 alphabet forms of Unown, you can go through the Maniac Tunnel to reach

Dowsing Machine
to find and return it. The key is difficult to find with the
Dowsing Machine
due to its small size. You can find it by facing south and standing one step down from the stairs that are near the southern exit.

Pastoria City
is home to the
Great Marsh
, where many Pokémon can be found, though it will require multiple visits on separate days to see all of them. One of those Pokémon is
Tropius
, which can learn
Fly
along with four other
HM
moves. It will be very useful if you cannot or do not want to teach those HM moves to the Pokémon that you use in battle.
Pastoria is also home to the Scarf Guy, who lives in the house nearest to
Route 213
. The Scarf Guy checks a Pokémon's
condition
to see if it is worthy of a
Scarf
. If the Pokémon's condition is at its maximum value in an area, he will give out the corresponding Scarf to that Pokémon. If not, he will tell the player to improve its condition with
Poffins
.

. Heart Scales can be found in various locations in throughout
Sinnoh
, including the
Underground
, and the
Pokémon News Press
in
Solaceon Town
.
Go to the westernmost house to meet a woman who will give you a
Berry
once a day. These Berries will notably be the ones that reduce the damage of supereffective attacks on the Pokémon that holds it.
