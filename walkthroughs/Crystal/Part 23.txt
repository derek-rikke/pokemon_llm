Roadblock
The wild
Snorlax
is still sleeping on the east side of
Vermilion City
, blocking travel to and from
Route 11
. It also happens to be blocking the western entrance to
Diglett's Cave
. To wake it up, tune the
Pokégear
's radio to Channel 20.0, then examine the creature to place the device next to it. The
Poké Flute
music rouses the Pokémon from its nap, and it attacks in a grumpy rage!

Pewter Gym
Pewter Gym
Pewter City Pokémon Gym
Leader: Brock
The Rock Solid Pokémon Trainer
The
Pewter Gym
specializes in
Rock-type
Pokémon. Rock-type moves are super effective against
Bug
-,
Fire
-,
Flying
-, and
Ice-type
Pokémon, while Rock-type Pokémon are weak to
Fighting
-,
Grass
-,
Ground
-,
Steel
-, and
Water-type
moves.
The Gym features a rock garden, and has only one optional Gym Trainer battle before reaching the
Gym Leader
.
Because of their dual typings, each of
Brock
's five Pokémon take massive damage from
Grass-type
attacks. Aside from that,
Water
moves are effective against his
Graveler
,
Rhyhorn
, and
Onix
. Brock likes to dig for fossils in
Mt. Moon
in his spare time, and has acquired two prehistoric Pokémon in
Omastar
and
Kabutops
. Both are vulnerable to
Electric
attacks, but Electric Pokémon should be wary of being hit with
Earthquake
.

The Silver Feather
There is an elderly man strolling around the east side of town. Speak to him, and he reminisces about training in
Johto
as a young man. Something about you reminds him of his younger self, and he is happy to give you a treasure that he found there all those years ago: the
Silver Wing
. This shimmering feather lets you track down
the immense, silver-colored Pokémon
that roosted atop the
Burned Tower
before it was destroyed.
