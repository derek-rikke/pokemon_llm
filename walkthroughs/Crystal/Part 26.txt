Nature's Madness
When the island's volcano erupted, most buildings were either buried in rubble or swept into the sea, and only the Pokémon Center has since been rebuilt. According to a man inside the building, it has been a year since the eruption. A sign posted outside notifies visitors that the
Cinnabar Gym
has relocated to the nearby
Seafoam Islands
.
The Final Gym Leader
Speak to the man behind the Pokémon Center, and he introduces himself as
Blue
. He is not in the mood to battle at the moment, as he contemplates the power of nature and the destruction around him. He invites you to challenge him at the
Viridian Gym
, then leaves.

Seafoam Islands
Just as the beach near
Fuchsia City
is littered with volcanic rocks, the
Seafoam Islands
were also damaged by volcanic debris. The entrance to the western island was destroyed, while subsequent collapses have reduced the eastern island to a single small chamber. It is this tiny cave that houses the relocated
Cinnabar Gym
.
Cinnabar Gym
Cinnabar City Pokémon Gym
Leader: Blaine
The
Cinnabar Gym
specializes in
Fire-type
Pokémon. Fire-type moves are super effective against
Bug
-,
Grass
-,
Ice
-, and
Steel-type
Pokémon, while Fire-type Pokémon are weak to
Ground
-,
Rock
-, and
Water-type
moves.
As the
Gym Leader
enjoys riddles, he had equipped his Gym with machines that would display a quiz when examined. However, these machines were destroyed in
Cinnabar
's eruption, so there are no puzzles to solve here. There are no Gym Trainers either, allowing challengers to reach the Gym Leader immediately.
Blaine
's
Magcargo
has high
Defense
, so
special moves
will fare better against it. Due to its
Fire
/
Rock
typing,
Water
attacks will be especially useful. Intending to account for one of his team's weaknesses, Blaine has taught his
Magmar
ThunderPunch
in order to fight back against Water Pokémon.
Rapidash
has high
Speed
and physical
Attack
, but its
physical moves
have low power.
Fire Blast
may cause a
burn
, so be sure to bring some
Burn Heals
.
