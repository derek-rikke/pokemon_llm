Ecruteak City

, between Routes

, and

. The city honors its past by preserving long-held traditions, like the old-fashioned architecture of the local dance theater and the two towers that stand to the north. Several legendary Pokémon have ties to the area, giving Ecruteak an air of mystery.

Visit the southwest house and speak to the man inside. He gives you an

Pokémon Center
Time-Traveling Trades
Enter the Pokémon Center to meet
Bill
, the creator of the
Pokémon Storage System
. He has just finished maintenance on the
Time Capsule
, a machine located on the second floor of every Pokémon Center that allows Trainers to "trade with
the past
". There are certain restrictions, as all Pokémon and moves that were still undiscovered then are prohibited. The Time Capsule will be operational in 24 hours. After a brief explanation, Bill leaves for his home in
Goldenrod City
.
Ecruteak Dance Theater
The Ecruteak Dance Theater is where the
Kimono Girls
practice both their dancing and their Pokémon training. Each of the five sisters specializes in one of
Eevee
's
evolutions
. They may be battled in any order. After they have been defeated, speak to the Gentleman in the audience. He has challenged the sisters repeatedly but has failed each time. To reward you for defeating them when he could not, he gives you
HM03
(
Surf
).
Burned Tower
Burned Tower, 1F
Burned Tower, B1F
The charred ruins of the
Burned Tower
lie in the northwest part of the city. Formerly known as the Brass Tower, it was once as majestic as the
Tin Tower
to the east. When it was new, it was said to be the roost of
an immense, silver-colored Pokémon
. But centuries later, a heavy storm rolled in and the tower was struck by lightning, igniting a great fire that would rage for three days. The silver Pokémon and
the glorious, rainbow-colored Pokémon
that roosted on Tin Tower escaped to the skies unharmed, and the silver Pokémon flew away, never to return. A sudden downpour would finally douse the flames, and the rainbow Pokémon gave new life to
three nameless Pokémon
that perished in the blaze before it flew off as well.

Chasing the Wind
Upon entering the tower, you are approached by a man who introduces himself as
Eusine
. He is a researcher of the three
Legendary beasts
, and has been searching for a Pokémon named
Suicune
. He has traveled to the tower to investigate rumors that Suicune has been spotted inside. The local
Gym Leader
,
Morty
, is also here searching alongside Eusine for clues about the three beasts.
Long Gone Lugia
As you approach the fenced-in central area, you find
Silver
searching for
the legendary Pokémon
that used to roost here. He is annoyed that his visit was pointless, and blames you before drawing you into battle.
Rival Battle 3
Silver
has added another new Pokémon to his team since the previous battle.
Magnemite
takes serious damage from
Fire
-,
Ground
-, and
Fighting-type
attacks. For Trainers who chose
Cyndaquil
, or traded for the
Machop
in
Goldenrod City
, it will likely be little threat. His
Gastly
has since evolved into
Haunter
, but is still vulnerable to the same
Ghost
-,
Psychic
-, and
Dark-type
moves. Use
Rock
- and
Electric-type
moves against his
Zubat
for greatest effect. The Pokémon that he took from
Elm
's lab has grown a few levels but otherwise has not changed since the previous battle.

Afterward, Silver shrugs off his loss, declaring that you would never be able to catch a legendary Pokémon anyway. Suddenly, the unstable floor gives way, dropping you down to the basement.
B1F
On the lower level, you find yourself standing before
three mysterious Pokémon
. They do not react until approached, when two of the three immediately dash off in different directions and begin
racing across the land
.
The third Pokémon
pauses for a moment to examine you before rushing off like the others. They can be encountered almost anywhere but flee from humans immediately. After seeing them in battle, the Pokédex tracks their movements.
Eusine
is waiting to speak to you afterward, and was shocked to see Suicune run past him. He has tracked the Pokémon for ten years and only now got to finally see it, thanks to you. He intends to continue his search, and hopes to meet you again.
Tin Tower
The
Tin Tower
stands tall in the northeast part of the city. It is a sacred place, and is off-limits to all but a few people. Ecruteak's Fog Badge gets you inside, but no higher than the first floor. Two
legendary
artifacts
are required to reach the rest of the tower.
Ecruteak Gym
Ecruteak Gym
Ecruteak City Pokémon Gym
Leader: Morty
The Mystic Seer of the Future
The
Ecruteak Gym
specializes in
Ghost-type
Pokémon. Ghost-type moves are super effective against Ghost- and
Psychic-type
Pokémon, while Ghost-type Pokémon are weak to Ghost- and
Dark-type
moves.
Normal
- and
Fighting-type
moves will have no effect.
The Gym features what appears to be a bottomless pit, with an invisible bridge crossing over it. Challengers who step in the wrong place are returned to the entrance. The Gym Trainers are positioned along this hidden walkway, giving the impression that they are floating in the air. The path to the
Gym Leader
mostly follows each Gym Trainer's line of sight.
Morty
's Pokémon tend to use indirect attacks to harass their target.
Spite
and
Curse
drain the target's energy, while
Lick
and
Hypnosis
can inflict status ailments. Most of his Pokémon can even use
Mean Look
to prevent escape.
Ghost-type
Pokémon are vulnerable to Ghost- and
Dark-type
moves, but
Psychic
- and
Ground-type
attacks are an equally effective way to target their secondary
Poison
typing, instead.
