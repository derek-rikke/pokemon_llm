Silph Co.
Silph Co.
is open to the public, but ever since it was attacked by
Team Rocket
several years ago
, visitors are restricted to the first floor. A security guard blocks the stairs but gives out an
Up-Grade
, one of the company's newest products that has not yet been released, as a souvenir.
Magnet Train Station
The
Magnet Train
station is located in the northwest part of the city. The train uses electricity and magnets to attain incredible speed, but is not running at the moment because of some problem at the
Kanto Power Plant
.
Fighting Dojo
Saffron City
is unique as the only city to have two Pokémon Gyms. The
Fighting Dojo
is located in the northeast neighborhood, next door to the
Saffron Gym
. The two clubs had once competed to determine which would become the city's one official Gym, and the
Psychic
Pokémon of Saffron Gym were victorious. A Black Belt informs visitors that the dojo's leader,
the Karate Master
, is in
a cave
in
Johto
for training. A
Focus Band
can be found near the rear wall.
Saffron Gym
Saffron Gym
Saffron City Pokémon Gym
Leader: Sabrina
The Master of Psychic Pokémon
The
Saffron Gym
specializes in
Psychic-type
Pokémon. Psychic-type moves are super effective against
Fighting
- and
Poison-type
Pokémon, while Psychic-type Pokémon are weak to
Bug
-,
Dark
-, and
Ghost-type
moves.
The Gym uses
a series of warp tiles
to confuse and disorient any challengers. Step on the tile near the entrance to reach the southeast room. To reach the Gym Leader by using as few warps as possible, continue by stepping on the northwest, southwest, and southwest tiles in the following rooms. This leads to the center room, where
Sabrina
awaits anyone up to the challenge.
Although
Sabrina
has only three Pokémon, they can become difficult to defeat if given the chance. She leads with her
Espeon
; its
Sand-Attack
move cuts the target's
Accuracy
, while
Mr. Mime
and
Alakazam
can use
Reflect
to raise her team's physical
Defense
, a common vulnerability for Psychic Pokémon. All three can use the move
Psychic
, a strong attack that may also lower the target's
Special Defense
, letting it deal even more damage on the next hit. It is especially dangerous when used by Espeon and Alakazam, due to their high
Special Attack
ratings.
