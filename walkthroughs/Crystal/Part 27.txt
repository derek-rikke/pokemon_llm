Viridian City Pokémon Gym
Leader: ...
The
Viridian Gym
has no type specialty, as
Blue
prefers to use the same Pokémon from his time as Champion.
The Gym features no puzzles, and there are no Gym Trainers to battle here.
As
Blue
's team is more diverse than those of other
Gym Leaders
, defeating him will not be as easy.
Electric
attacks fare well against his
Pidgeot
and
Gyarados
, while they—and
Arcanine
—are also vulnerable to
Rock
moves.
Bug
-,
Ghost
-, and
Dark-type
moves are effective against his
Alakazam
and
Exeggutor
.
Water-type
attacks are best against both his
Rhydon
and Arcanine. Blue's team has access to powerful attacks, so use healing items often and switch Pokémon out as necessary to keep up the pressure.

, it is now possible to venture westward to

. The guards that had blocked off the two side hallways are gone, allowing Trainers to travel between
Johto
and
Kanto
on foot, without the need for the
Magnet Train
or the
S.S. Aqua
.
Route 28
Route 28
Route 28
is a hidden mountain road in western

. The path leads westward from the
Pokémon League Reception Gate
and crosses into

at the entrance to

The Recluse
The uneven terrain forces travelers to pass by the entrance to
Mt. Silver
in order to reach the route's northern area. Use
Cut
to clear a path and visit the house on the hill. The woman inside is a celebrity trying to maintain her privacy, and gives you a second copy of
TM47
(
Steel Wing
) to keep her hideaway a secret.
Mt. Silver
Mt. Silver, Exterior
The uneven road from
Route 28
leads directly to a Pokémon Center at the foot of the mountain. This gives anyone attempting to scale the mountain one last opportunity to make preparations.
Surf
and
Waterfall
are required to fully explore the cave network, while the darkness of the first chamber makes
Flash
useful, as well.
