Pokémon Center
The Rainbow Pokémon's Return
Eusine
has returned to his hometown, and can now be found inside the Pokémon Center.
Suicune
has already been captured, but
Raikou
and
Entei
may still be on the loose, racing around
Johto
. Return here and speak to him once all three
legendary beasts
have been caught, and he informs you of recent rumors of
a rainbow-colored Pokémon
appearing at
Tin Tower
. He then leaves for
Ecruteak City
to investigate.
Celadon Mansion
After the sun sets, follow the path behind the Pokémon Center and enter the
Celadon Mansion
through the back door. Speak to the man on the roof to hear a scary story, and receive
TM03
(
Curse
) for listening to it.
Restaurant
The restaurant on the south side of town is currently hosting an eat-a-thon. Check the trash can by the counter to find some
Leftovers
, which restore a bit of the holder's health every turn.
Game Corner
The prizes offered next door are expensive, so it will require a large number of coins to receive all of them. Coins may be purchased at the counter in sets of 50 for
$
1,000 each, and sets of 500 for
$
1,000 each. Much of the building is occupied by traditional
slot machines
, while the first two available rows from the left feature a
card flip
game, instead.
Prize Corner
Like the
Goldenrod Game Corner
, this one also offers rare Pokémon and items as prizes.

Celadon Gym
Celadon Gym
Celadon City Pokémon Gym
Leader: Erika
The Nature-Loving Princess
The
Celadon Gym
specializes in
Grass-type
Pokémon. Grass-type moves are super effective against
Ground
-,
Rock
-, and
Water-type
Pokémon, while Grass-type Pokémon are weak to
Bug
-,
Fire
-,
Flying
-,
Ice
-, and
Poison-type
moves.
The Gym is designed as a greenhouse, with many flower arrangements on display. There are no puzzles to solve, and only a few Gym Trainers to defeat in order to reach the
Gym Leader
.
Erika
leads with her
Tangela
. Its
Bind
move restricts the target's movement, as does
Sleep Powder
. Its
Special Defense
is low, so prioritize using
Fire
and
Ice
moves against it for greatest effect. Three of
Jumpluff
's moves steal the target's
HP
, while the fourth sharply reduces its
Speed
. As a
Grass
/
Flying
Pokémon, it takes massive damage from Ice-type moves. As plants rely on the sun for nutrients, Erika's remaining two Pokémon rely on
Sunny Day
to prepare their combination moves.
Victreebel
regains more HP than normal under
harsh sunlight
with
Synthesis
, and
Bellossom
does the same. Under these conditions, Bellossom can launch its strongest move,
SolarBeam
, without first taking a turn to charge it.
