1F
Missing Child
Soon after boarding the ship, a Gentleman bumps into you. The man is distraught, and apologies as he explains that his young granddaughter is missing. He asks that you let him know if she is found, and hurries off to continue his search.
The Search Begins
Professor Elm
's
S.S. Ticket
reserves the cabin at the far end of the first hallway, marked by a Sailor standing just outside. The room features a
PC
and a cozy bed, the perfect place to take a nap and restore health.
Two of the other cabins nearest the entrance are empty, while Hiker Noland can be found in the one between them. On the opposide side of the ship, the cabin nearest the stairs belongs to the grandfather. The next cabin over belongs to PokéFan Colin and Twins Meg & Peg. The fourth cabin is empty, and the last one belongs to Firebreather Lyle. There is no unaccompanied little girl to be found here, so head downstairs to check the lower deck.
B1F
A Sailor blocks the way. Speak to him, and he asks that you find another Sailor for him as he cannot leave his post.
1F
Sailor Stanly can now be found in the cabin next to your own. He claims that he was not goofing off, but that the room was vacant, so he took a quick nap. Defeat him, and he returns to his post.
B1F
The Sailor thanks you for finding Stanly, and mentions that he may have seen a little girl around here. In the nearest room, the seasick Juggler Fritz is hunched over a trash can. Sailor Jeff can be found in the second room, and Picnicker Debra stands in the hallway. There is still no little girl to be seen, so take the stairs up to the Captain's cabin.
1F
Captain's cabin
The little girl is located here, safe but bored, and keeps trying to get the Captain to play with her. Realizing that her grandfather has been worried about her, she rushes off and you both return to the grandfather's cabin. As thanks for seeing his granddaughter returned safely, he rewards you with a
Metal Coat
. A moment later, the Captain announces that the ship has now arrived in
Vermilion City
.
After this initial trip to
Kanto
, the ship sails from Kanto to
Johto
every Sunday and Wednesday, and from Johto to Kanto every Monday and Friday.
Vermilion City
Vermilion City
Vermilion City
is a popular port city located between
Route 6
and
Route 11
. Vermilion Harbor sees many ships coming and going, and the Pokémon Fan Club is located on the west side of town. The eastern exit, and the east end of
Diglett's Cave
, are currently blocked by a sleeping
Snorlax
. The
Vermilion Gym
stands in the southwest.

that looks like a Clefairy. Speak to the Chairman to hear a long-winded story about his prized

Vermilion Gym
Vermilion Gym
Vermilion City Pokémon Gym
Leader: Lt. Surge
The Lightning American
The
Vermilion Gym
specializes in
Electric-type
Pokémon. Electric-type moves are super effective against
Flying
- and
Water-type
Pokémon, while Electric-type Pokémon are weak to
Ground-type
moves.
The Gym features an array of trash cans, two of which conceal a hidden switch. Normally, these two switches must be found and flipped in order to unlock the door to the
Gym Leader
's room. However, they are currently inactive, so there are no puzzles to solve before reaching the Gym Leader.
Lt. Surge
's
Magneton
knows the powerful
Zap Cannon
attack. Though guaranteed to cause
paralysis
, it has only 50%
Accuracy
; however, using
Lock-On
first ensures that it connects with the target. His two
Electrode
are nearly identical, so be aware that either one could
explode
without warning.
Ground-type
Pokémon are immune to
Electric
attacks, but a good alternative would be to use
Grass-type
Pokémon, as they resist Electric moves. Electric Pokémon tend to have higher
Speed
, so consider making use of items like
Quick Claw
and
X Speed
.
