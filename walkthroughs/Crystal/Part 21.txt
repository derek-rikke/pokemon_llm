Safari Zone Warden's house
The southeastern house belongs to
the Safari Zone warden
. According to his granddaughter, he closed the
Safari Zone
rather suddenly and left to vacation somewhere overseas. Many saw this as a disappointing development, as residents and tourists alike would visit the nature preserve for their chance at catching some of the rare Pokémon inside. The northern part of the city was once occupied by exhibits that housed rare Pokémon, as well, but they have since fallen into disrepair and the Pokémon have wandered off into the surrounding wilderness.

Fuchsia City Pokémon Gym
Leader: Janine
The Poisonous Ninja Master
The
Fuchsia Gym
specializes in
Poison-type
Pokémon. Poison-type moves are super effective against
Grass-type
Pokémon, while Poison-type Pokémon are weak to
Ground
- and
Psychic-type
moves.
The Gym Leader is trained in the skills of the ninja, and has installed a series of nearly invisible glass panels to disorient any challengers. In addition, each of the Gym Trainers has disguised themselves as the
Gym Leader
. Follow the east wall toward the back of the building, then loop around toward the front. The Gym Leader is located in the southwest part of the building.
Janine
's Pokémon use
poisoning
and
confusion
to incapacitate their opponent. Her
Crobat
is fast, so hit it with
Psychic
-,
Electric
-,
Ice
-, or
Rock-type
attacks to take it down quickly. Both of her
Weezing
are dangerous, as
Toxic
badly poisons the target, and
Explosion
is a last-ditch move that deals massive damage. Their phsycial
Defense
is high, so use Psychic-type moves to target their lower
Special Defense
instead.
Ariados
can lower the target's
Speed
and steal its
HP
for itself, while
Venomoth
prefers to use poison- and confusion-inducing moves. As
Bug
Pokémon, both take serious damage from
Fire
-, Rock-, and
Flying-type
attacks.

Road Closed
The ocean route leading southward is blocked by rocky debris. According to the guard in the gate, these boulders landed here as a result of
Cinnabar Island
's volcano erupting. The only other way out of
Fuchsia City
is east to
