Indigo Plateau
The
Indigo Plateau
serves as the capital for the
Pokémon League
in the
Johto
and
Kanto
regions. This is where the Trainers who have defeated all eight
Gym Leaders
in either region battle against the
Elite Four
and the
Champion
. The entrance hall houses a Pokémon Center and a Poké Mart, allowing challengers to prepare themselves and their Pokémon for the gauntlet ahead. The Elite Four is a group of talented Pokémon Trainers second only to the Champion in terms of power, and must be fought in succession with no break. These five battles will not be easy, but challengers who bring their strongest Pokémon and a healthy supply of Potions and Revives may finally find themselves in the
Hall of Fame
. Anyone who decides to continue their training before challenging the league may speak to the elderly man, and his
Abra
will teleport them away to
New Bark Town
.

Elite Four
Battle 1
Will's room
The first member of the Elite Four is
Will
, a master of
Psychic-type
Pokémon. Psychic-type moves are super effective against
Fighting
- and
Poison-type
Pokémon, while Psychic-type Pokémon are weak to
Bug
-,
Dark
-, and
Ghost-type
moves.
Both of Will's
Xatu
can use
Future Sight
, which launches an attack that strikes two turns later. In addition to Ghost- and Dark-type moves, they both sustain serious damage from
Electric-type
attacks, as does his
Slowbro
. Its
Amnesia
move raises its
Special Defense
, so use Bug- and Ghost-type moves to target its physical Defense, instead. Bug and Fire attacks work well against both
Exeggutor
and
Jynx
.

Battle 2
Koga's room
The second member of the Elite Four is
Koga
, a master of
Poison-type
Pokémon, and former
Gym Leader
from
Kanto
's
Fuchsia City
. Poison-type moves are super effective against
Grass-type
Pokémon, while Poison-type Pokémon are weak to
Ground
- and
Psychic-type
moves.
As
Koga
is a master ninja, his team makes use of poisoning and confusion to wear down their target.
Psychic-type
attacks will be the most useful, as they deal serious damage to four of his five Pokémon.
Rock
moves are useful against his
Ariados
,
Venomoth
, and
Crobat
, and all three of his
Bug
Pokémon are also vulnerable to
Fire
attacks. Watch out for
Forretress
'
Explosion
, and be sure to bring healing items to cure any Pokémon that gets poisoned with
Toxic
.

Defeating Koga opens the door to the third room.
Battle 3
Bruno's room
The third member of the Elite Four is
Bruno
, a master of
Fighting-type
Pokémon. Fighting-type moves are super effective against
Dark
-,
Ice
-,
Normal
-,
Rock
-, and
Steel-type
Pokémon, while Fighting-type Pokémon are weak to
Flying
- and
Psychic-type
moves.
Psychic-type
attacks will do well against four of
Bruno
's five Pokémon, but Psychic Pokémon should avoid
Hitmontop
's
Pursuit
, a
Dark-type
move.
Flying-type
attacks are equally useful, but
Machamp
can fight back against Flying Pokémon with
Rock Slide
.
Fire Punch
,
Ice Punch
, and
ThunderPunch
may seem intimidating, but
Hitmonchan
's
Special Attack
is too low to make effective use of them. As a
Rock
/
Ground
Pokémon, not only is
Onix
the only one of Bruno's team that is not
Fighting
type, but it is also the only one to sustain massive damage from both
Water
- and
Grass-type
attacks.

Battle 4
Karen's room
The fourth member of the Elite Four is
Karen
, a master of
Dark-type
Pokémon. Dark-type moves are super effective against
Ghost
- and
Psychic-type
Pokémon, while Dark-type Pokémon are weak to
Bug
- and
Fighting-type
moves.
With its high defenses and
status moves
to hinder its target,
Umbreon
can be difficult to take down.
Mean Look
prevents
escape
, which can lock the opponent into an unfavorable matchup; leading with a
Bug
or
Fighting
Pokémon, like
Heracross
, can turn this into an advantage.
Ice-type
moves are effective against
Vileplume
and
Murkrow
, while Murkrow and
Houndoom
also take serious damage from
Rock
attacks. Use
Ghost
- and
Dark-type
moves against
Gengar
before it can use
Curse
.

With the Elite Four defeated, the door to the Champion's room is unlocked. Take a moment to prepare your Pokémon now, as you will be drawn into battle immediately upon entering the next room. Only one person stands between you and the title of Champion!
Champion
Lance's room
Hall of Fame room
The final opponent turns out to be
Lance
, the same
Dragon
Pokémon master who helped defeat
Team Rocket
. Dragon-type moves are super effective against Dragon-type Pokémon, while Dragon-type Pokémon are weak to Dragon- and
Ice-type
moves.
Lance
begins with his
Gyarados
, which takes massive damage from
Electric-type
attacks.
Charizard
has the same problem with
Rock
moves, while both it and
Aerodactyl
take serious damage from
Water
attacks. His three
Dragonite
each have a powerful move—
Blizzard
,
Thunder
, and
Fire Blast
—to help cover the team's vulnerabilities. However, as
Dragon
/
Flying
Pokémon, they fare poorly in the cold and sustain massive damage from
Ice-type
attacks. All of his Pokémon can use
Hyper Beam
, so be sure to bring plenty of
HP
-restoring items!

Lance
congratulates you for defeating the Pokémon League, and compliments you on growing so much with your Pokémon. He is soon interrupted by
DJ Mary
, who rushes in for an interview. She would have been here sooner, but
Professor Oak
is not as quick as he was in his younger days. He applauds your victory, saying that your Pokémon won because they believed in you as a Trainer. Mary tries again for an interview, but Lance steps in and leads you to the next room.
Hall of Fame
The
Hall of Fame
is where all victorious Trainers and their dedicated Pokémon will be recorded, as a testament to their power and perseverance.
Lance
remarks that it has been a long time sine he was last here, and goes on to explain the large machine. He then activates it, officially recording both you and your Pokémon as the latest inductees into the Hall of Fame.
The game is saved, a slideshow of your victorious Pokémon plays, and the credits roll.
