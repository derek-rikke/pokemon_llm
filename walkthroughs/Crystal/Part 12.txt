Defeated, he wonders aloud if what

told him about not treating his Pokémon properly is true, but refuses to give up on becoming stronger.
The Shifting Shutters
After
Silver
leaves, there are three Rocket Grunts along the north wall. Defeat them all, then turn your attention to the three switches on the wall behind them. These switches are numbered from 1 to 3, starting with the eastern one. Each of these switches controls a different group of shutters to the south. To reset the puzzle, either flip each switch again or leave and re-enter the room.
Flip Switch #1 to reach a
Full Heal
in the northeast room. This also gives access to a hidden
Max Potion
in the north-central room.
Flip the switches in a five-part sequence (#1, #3, #2, #1, #3) to reach a
Smoke Ball
in the southwest room.
To clear the maze, flip each switch once in descending order (#3, #2, #1). This also gives access to a hidden
Revive
in the northwest room.
After exiting the maze, defeat the female Rocket Grunt and pass through the double doors.
Warehouse
Go north to reach an
Ultra Ball
, then follow the winding hallway past the first Rocket Grunt to reach a
Max Ether
in the southeast corner. Battle a second Rocket Grunt in the northeast, then detour up the nearby stairs; this leads to a blocked-off area in the
Department Store
's basement and an
Amulet Coin
. Continue westward to fight a third Rocket Grunt. Pick up
TM35
(
Sleep Talk
) in the interior room, then speak to the Director. After hearing about
Team Rocket
occupying the
Radio Tower
, he begs for your help and gives you a
Card Key
. This card unlocks the shutter on the tower's third floor. Climb the northeast stairs again and take the elevator up from the basement.
Radio Tower
With the
Card Key
in hand, it is time to defeat
Team Rocket
once and for all!

Enter the studio to reach

. He reveals the details of their plan: to take over the radio station and announce their return. Their hope is that hearing this broadcast will bring their leader,
Giovanni
, back from his solo training so that he can lead them to regain their former glory. He refuses to let you interfere any further, and draws you into battle.

Conceding defeat, the Rocket Executive formally disbands
Team Rocket
, just as
Giovanni
did before him. The Rockets flee the building, and the Director returns a moment later. He exclaims that your courageous actions have saved Pokémon nationwide, and rewards you with a
Clear Bell
. He explains that there used to be a different tower at this site, but it was old and unstable. This gleaming bell was dug up during demolition to make way for the new Radio Tower. He wonders aloud if it might have some connection to
Ecruteak
's
Tin Tower
, then suddenly remembers overhearing a conversation between
Team Rocket
members. He says that they were whispering about something going on at that same tower, and suggests looking into it before leaving for his office. Pick up the
Ultra Ball
in the studio here, and then as you exit the tower, speak to
DJ Mary
on 4F (East) for a
Pink Bow
, and the girl on 3F to get
TM11
(
Sunny Day
).
Ecruteak City
Barrier Station
In the building at the foot of
Tin Tower
, one of the tower's caretakers informs you that a momentous event has occurred. He initially asks you to leave, but relents when he hears the
Clear Bell
begin ringing gently. The bell's chime is said to reflect the bearer's soul, and he believes that you may be able to make it through the tower.
As you approach the exit, you are blocked by a group known as the Wise Trio. They speak of a legend in which a Trainer with the ability to touch the souls of Pokémon is tested by a Pokémon that appears at
Tin Tower
. They excitedly inform you that the legend has come true, as
Suicune
has appeared at the tower. The trio intends to test your worthiness to meet the beast. Between battles, they offer more insight into the local legends.

Afterward, the trio explains that they have been charged with protecting the legendary Pokémon, and are to allow passage only to those who possess "the power and soul of truth". They invite you to enter the tower, where
Suicune
awaits. Follow the trail to the tower, and be sure to save the game.
Tin Tower
1F
When you step inside, the three
legendary beasts
can be seen standing together near the central pillar. Immediately noticing your presence,
Raikou
and
Entei
each leap over the fence with a roar before racing out of the tower.
Suicune
clears the fence with a roar of its own and lands directly in front of you, forcing you into battle.
VS Suicune
The legendary
Suicune
has appeared! Begin with
Grass
- and
Electric-type
attacks to wear its health down quickly, then follow up with Water-,
Fire
-,
Ice
-, and
Steel-type
moves to chip away at it even further. Consider inflicting status ailments like
Sleep
and
Paralysis
to restrict its movements.

Eusine
and the Wise Trio enter the tower when the battle ends. Eusine claims that
Suicune
's mystic power is said to summon
a rainbow-colored Pokémon
, and wonders aloud if these events will cause it to appear. He intends to continue studying these legends, and thanks you for the fantastic battle as he leaves. If spoken with, the trio recounts the tale of the
Brass Tower
; the
three Pokémon
that perished in the blaze, and the rainbow-colored Pokémon descending from the sky to give them new life.
The next destination is
Blackthorn City
, to the east of
Mahogany Town
.
Mahogany Town
With
Team Rocket
gone, the souvenir shop's owner and her granddaughter have returned to reopen their store. The shady salesman who blocked the way eastward to

Head to the southeast area to find the third boulder; move it to the southeast hole, then continue northward. Finally, push the fourth boulder to the north-central hole. With all four boulders cleared, climb down the northeast ladder.
B2F (West)
The four boulders from the floor above have fallen in a spiral shape that grants access to the ladder in the middle of the chamber. Before continuing on, there are several items that can be found nearby, including a
Max Potion
. To reach the middle area, begin in the northeast corner and stand on the southwestern-most point of clear ground, then slide westward across the ice. Move in a clockwise direction from here to reach the patch of clear ground in the center, and collect the
