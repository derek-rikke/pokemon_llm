Bug-Catching Contest
There is no entry fee for the
Bug-Catching Contest
. Anyone may enter once per day, every
Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday
.
To compete, Trainers must catch the single best
Bug-type
Pokémon they can find. To do this, Trainers are given 20
Park Balls
and are only allowed to use a single Pokémon from their party. The others remain with the contest officials until the competition is over. Any Pokémon caught will be recorded in the Pokédex, but only one Pokémon may be kept to be judged. The Pokémon selected to be judged may be kept after the competition.
The competition ends when 20 minutes have passed, all
Park Balls
have been used, or the Trainer
blacks out
, leaves the park, or chooses to quit. After that, the judging will occur, in which Trainers are scored on their skills of capturing rare and powerful Pokémon.

An Inconvenient Tree
The odd tree mentioned by the women in
Goldenrod City
's flower shop can be found in the middle of the route, blocking travel from every direction. Despite its tree-like appearance, this oddity actually tries to avoid water. Speak to the girl standing nearby; this is Floria, the sister of the flower shop's owner. She believes that the tree must actually be a Pokémon, and would be shocked out of its disguise if watered. She leaves to inform her sister and borrow her water bottle.
Return to the
flower shop
and speak to the owner. She believes that this is too dangerous for her sister, but upon seeing your
Plain Badge
, gives the
SquirtBottle
to you instead. Use this to splash a bit of water on it, and it attacks! It turns out to be a
Sudowoodo
, a rare Pokémon that is more similar to a rock than a tree.
