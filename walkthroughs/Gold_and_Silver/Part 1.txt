The journey begins in
New Bark Town
, in the southeast part of the
Johto
region. It is a rather small, sleepy town with only four buildings. The northeastern house belongs to you and
Mom
, while the southern one is home to the resident researcher of the Johto region,
Professor Elm
. The large building to the north is Elm's Laboratory. The west side of town leads to the
tall grasses
of

The
PC
in the corner acts as your
item storage
. Since each pocket on your
Pack
can only hold 20 different
items
, it would be necessary to use or discard some before obtaining anything new. The PC can hold up to 50 different items.
Deposit Item
and
Withdraw Item
allow for moving items between inventory and storage, while
Toss Item
discards an item permanently. There is also a
Mailbox
function to store pieces of
Mail
, as well as a
Decoration
option.
To save the game, press
Start
to open the main menu, select
Save
, and then
Yes
. When the menu disappears, your progress is saved and it is safe to exit the game.
To go downstairs, step on the stairs in the northeast corner of the room.
1F
Mom
is sitting at the table, and tells you that
Professor Elm
has been looking for you. Before you can leave, she tells you that your
Pokégear
is back from the repair shop. This device initially acts as a clock, but can perform other functions with the necessary expansion cards. Mom helps you finish setting up the Clock function by asking about the day of the week and
Daylight Saving Time
.
To leave the house, step on the floor mat along the south wall and press Down on the +Control Pad.
The Spy
A young, red-haired man
can be seen peering into Elm's Lab through a side window. If you try to speak to him, he shoves you back before returning to the window.
Professor Elm's Lab
Professor Elm
has a favor to ask of you. A friend of his, nicknamed
Mr. Pokémon
, studies Pokémon as a hobby and regularly contacts the professor about his findings. Elm suggests that these discoveries are not usually as exciting as his friend makes them out to be, but believes that this time is different. However, he and his aides are busy with their research, so he asks that you go in his place. To accompany you on the trip, he lets you choose one of his rare Pokémon. Each has its advantages and disadvantages, so simply choose the one that you like the best.

The
Grass-type
Chikorita
does well against
Water
-,
Rock
-, and
Ground-type
Pokémon. It also has the most weaknesses of the trio, and fares poorly against
Fire
-,
Flying
-,
Bug
-,
Poison
-, and
Ice-type
attacks. Chikorita may struggle early on, making it better suited for those looking for a challenge.
The
Fire-type
Cyndaquil
is great when battling
Grass
-,
Bug
-,
Ice
-, and
Steel-type
Pokémon, but is vulnerable to
Water
-,
Rock
-, and
Ground-type
moves. Cyndaquil's typing gives it an easier time in the early part of the game, making it a good choice for less experienced Trainers.
The
Water-type
Totodile
has an advantage when facing
Fire
-,
Rock
-, and
Ground-type
Pokémon, but may struggle against
Grass
- and
Electric-type
attacks. It is the most well-rounded of the trio.
After choosing your
first partner Pokémon
,
Professor Elm
asks if you would like to give it a
nickname
, which may be up to ten characters long. Elm informs you that
Mr. Pokémon
lives a short distance from
Cherrygrove City
, to the west of
New Bark Town
. He invites you to return at any time and use his PC to heal your Pokémon, and gives you his phone number to register in your
Pokégear
. As you leave the building, his aide gives you a
Potion
.
Route 29
Route 29
Route 29
is a hilly path that runs west from
New Bark Town
to
Cherrygrove City
. Westbound travelers must pass through patches of
tall grass
, while eastbound travelers can jump over a series of
ledges
to avoid these grasses and the wild Pokémon inside. To the north,
Route 46
leads down from the mountains.

A Berry a Day
Examine the tree on the northwest hill to pick a
Berry
from it. There are several
different types of Berry
, each with its own restorative effect. This particular variety restores a Pokémon's
HP
by 10 points. Berries may be used by a Trainer, or consumed by a Pokémon during battle. Giving a natural item like this to a Pokémon to
hold
will let it use the item when it sees fit. Pokémon are unfamiliar with artificial items like
Potions
and cannot use them on their own. Berries grow back over time, so revisit the same tree the next day to find another one.
