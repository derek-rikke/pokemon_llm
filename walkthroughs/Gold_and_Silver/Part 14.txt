New Bark Town
Elm's Lab
When you return to Elm's Lab in
New Bark Town
,
the professor
thanks you for helping with his research. To show his appreciation, he rewards you with a
Master Ball
, a rare model of Poké Ball that catches any Pokémon without fail! According to Elm, this type of Poké Ball is usually given only to recognized Pokémon researchers, but he thinks that you will make better use of it than he would. It is best to use it when battling a Legendary Pokémon, as they can be very difficult to capture otherwise.
Leaving Home, Again
Use
Surf

New Bark Town
to reach
Route 27
.
Route 27
Route 27
Tohjo Falls
Route 27
is a seaside route that connects
New Bark Town
in the west and

.

Welcome to Kanto!
When you step out of the water, you draw the attention of a man standing nearby. He asks if you know what you have just done, and excitedly informs you that you have just taken your first step into the
Kanto
region.
Tohjo Falls
Tohjo Falls
is a small cave in southwest
Kanto
that serves to link the two regions together. As it cannot be cleared before obtaining
HM07
(
Waterfall
) and the
Rising Badge
, it also acts as a natural barrier so that only the strongest Trainers continue onward to the
Pokémon League
at

Victory Road
is a difficult tunnel separating the

. It serves as a final test for aspiring Trainers to prove themselves, as only the strongest reach the other side. The cave
was originally
a grueling hike, but later cave-ins have left the accessible areas diminished. The are also no other Trainers to be found inside, likely due to the risk of further collapse.

Rival Battle 5
Each of
Silver
's Pokémon has grown a few more levels since the last battle. His
Magnemite
has since evolved into

Kadabra
to his team, as well; as a
Psychic-type
Pokémon, Kadabra has low physical
Defense
and takes serious damage from
Bug
-,
Ghost
-, and
Dark-type
attacks.

Afterward, Silver admits that he may need some time for self-reflection to figure out why he cannot defeat you. He reaffirms his intent to keep getting stronger, and looks forward to the day when he finally beats you. He tells you to keep training until then, and leaves. Exit the cave to arrive at
Indigo Plateau
, the site of the Pokémon League.
