Blackthorn City
Blackthorn City
Blackthorn City
is located in the northeast part of
Johto
, between the
Ice Path
and
Route 45
. It is a mysterious mountain village cut directly into the rock face. Many residents go on to become
Dragon-type
specialists, perhaps due to the proximity of the
Dragon's Den
, a large cave underneath the city. Only those with the
Gym Leader
's permission may enter this cave, by crossing the lake behind the Gym.

Time for a Trade
Visit the eastern house to find a girl who would like to trade Pokémon. She is willing to part with her
Rhydon
in exchange for a female
Dragonair
. Dragonair can only be found with a
high-end fishing rod
, but its pre-evolved form,
Dratini
, can be found in the
Dragon's Den
and on
Route 45
.
Move Deleter
The southern house belongs to a man known as the
Move Deleter
. Using his free service allows a Pokémon to forget one of its moves. This is especially useful for removing moves taught by
HM
, as they would normally be permanent. This can also be used to prepare a Pokémon introduced in
Generation I
to be traded through the
Time Capsule
, as any moves introduced in
Generation II
would need to be removed first.
Blackthorn Gym
Blackthorn Gym, 1F
Blackthorn Gym, 2F
Blackthorn City Pokémon Gym
Leader: Clair
The Blessed User of Dragon Pokémon
The
Blackthorn Gym
specializes in
Dragon-type
Pokémon. Dragon-type moves are super effective against Dragon-type Pokémon, while Dragon-type Pokémon are weak to Dragon- and
Ice-type
moves.
The Gym is notably the only one to feature a second floor, as several boulders must be dropped into the lava pits to form a path. Battle Cooltrainer Paul and climb upstairs. Go south to fight Cooltrainer Fran and reach two more boulders in the southeast corner. Use
Strength
to move the right-hand boulder southward, then the left-hand boulder northward and drop it through the east-central hole. Battle Cooltrainer Cody to the north and push the final boulder to the northeast hole, then go down the eastern stairs. Fighting Cooltrainer Mike on the center platform is optional, but Cooltrainer Lola must be defeated in order to reach the
Gym Leader
.
Clair
's team features three
Dragonair
and a
Kingdra
. Her three Dragonair have nearly identical movesets, except for a single attack. Having access to
Ice Beam
,
Surf
, and
Thunderbolt
gives Clair an advantage when facing the Pokémon that you received from
Professor Elm
. As a part-
Water
Pokémon, her Kingdra takes serious damage only from
Dragon-type
attacks. Bring
Paralysis
-healing items, and use
HP
-restoring items often to keep from being caught off-guard by Kingdra's
Hyper Beam
.

After the battle,
Clair
is left in disbelief. She admits that she lost, but claims that you are still not ready for the Pokémon League, and insists that you take the "dragon user challenge". She informs you of the
Dragon's Den
, a large cave located under the city, and instructs you to bring her the
Dragon Fang
found inside. Doing so proves yourself as a "true dragon user", and only then will she give up the Rising Badge. Bring a Pokémon with
Surf
and
Whirlpool
, and cross the lake to reach the cave entrance behind the Gym.
Dragon's Den
Dragon's Den
The
Dragon's Den
is a large cavern located underneath
Blackthorn City
. It is a sacred home of
Dragon-type
Pokémon, and where the city's residents train to become Dragon-type specialists. A large shrine is located on an island to the south.

Clair
appears, and, seeing that you passed the test, finally awards you the
Rising Badge
. This Badge ensures obedience from all Pokémon and enables the use of
Waterfall
in the field. She also gives you
TM24
(
DragonBreath
) as a prize. Now that you have earned all eight Badges in the
Johto
region, Clair tells you that your next step will be the Pokémon League at
Indigo Plateau
. She advises you to
Surf
east from
New Bark Town
, but warns that the path ahead will be tough, and if you lose at the Pokémon League then she will feel even worse for having lost to you.
Elm's Request
Upon leaving the cave,
Professor Elm
calls to ask that you visit him at the Lab, as he has something for you.
Route 45
Route 45
Route 45
is a rugged road leading down from the mountains around
Blackthorn City
. The path splits and recombines multiple times, and the uneven terrain makes northbound travel impossible; this also forces travelers to visit multiple times to reach every area. The eastern entrance to
Dark Cave
is located on the north end of the route. The path eventually turns west at a small pond, where it connects to
Route 46
.

Turn east and use

on the southeast ridge, then go west along the water's edge to find
TM13
(
Snore
) on top of a ledge. Backtrack a bit and swim northward across the water, then walk westward along the ridge. Visit the northwest corner to find a shady man; you surprised him with your presence, and he gives you a pair of
BlackGlasses
to forget that you saw him here. Head south from here and jump a pair of ledges to reach the cave's western chamber.
Southwest chamber
To the west, there is a group of rocks arranged in a quarter-circle; there is a
Potion
in the middle, if you have not collected it by now. Use either
Rock Smash
or
Surf
to move southward, then use Rock Smash to continue to the east. Clear away another rock and loop around the northeast corner to reach a
Hyper Potion
. Jump the ledge and continue southward to pick up a
Full Heal
. The exit to
Route 46
is located to the south.
Don't Miss Marill!
Defeat Hiker Parry on the second ledge south of
Dark Cave
, then be sure to trade phone numbers with him. He will call occasionally to alert you about a
swarm
of a certain Pokémon species.
Marill
are usually difficult to find, but will be more likely to appear in
Mt. Mortar
for a short time. The swarm only lasts until midnight, so be quick!
Route 46
Route 46
Route 46
connects

Dark Cave
entrance.
