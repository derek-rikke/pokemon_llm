Beacon's Plight
When you approach the Gym,
Silver
is just leaving. He informs you that the Gym Leader is away at the lighthouse, taking care of a Pokémon that has fallen ill. He walks away, wondering aloud why she would do such a thing, as he firmly believes that any Pokémon unable to battle is worthless.
Fishing Guru 2
Visit the first house to the south of the Gym and speak to the Fisherman inside to receive a
Good Rod
. This mid-level fishing rod can reel in a greater variety of water-dwelling Pokémon than the
Old Rod
.
Time for a Trade
There are two houses standing side-by-side in the northeast part of town. Visit the western house to find a man who would like to trade Pokémon. He is willing to part with his
Voltorb
in exchange for a
Krabby
. Krabby can be found in
Olivine City
and on
Route 40
to the west, and is an easy catch with a
Good Rod
.
Olivine Café
The Olivine Café is located to the west of the Pokémon Center. Speak to the Sailor inside to receive
HM04
(
Strength
). This field move lets a compatible Pokémon move large boulders with ease.
Olivine Lighthouse
Olivine Lighthouse, Beacon Room
The
Olivine Lighthouse
is located in the southeast part of the city.
A certain Pokémon
usually serves as the lighthouse beacon to safely guide ships into the harbor, but has recently fallen ill.

across the sea in

, and as she cannot leave the Pokémon unattended, asks if you would bring their
medicine
back for Amphy.
