Beginning on the third floor, the tower features a series of ramps to confound any intruders looking to use the Legendary Pokémon for nefarious deeds. Pick up the

Whirl Islands
The
Whirl Islands
are connected underwater by a sprawling network of dark caves, where seawater and boulders restrict movement in certain areas. Despite being first seen on the initial visit to
Route 41
, it was impossible to fully explore the area without the field moves
Surf
,
Strength
, and
Whirlpool
, and difficult to do so without
Flash
, as well. Visitors may enter from any of the four islands, but those looking for
the immense, silver-colored Pokémon
should enter from the northeast island. By the time you receive the
Silver Wing
, the Legendary Pokémon has appeared in the deepest chamber.
