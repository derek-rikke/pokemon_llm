A colored background means that the Pokémon can be found in this location in the specified game. A white background with a colored letter means that the Pokémon cannot be found here.
Mt. Moon
Mt. Moon
Mt. Moon
is a mystical mountain that is known for its frequent meteor falls. The shards of stars that fall here are known as
Moon Stones
. Though it
was once
a large network of tunnels, the cave has since become unstable. Recent collapses have left most areas impassable except for one large chamber that links the two routes. This chamber also provides access to
Mt. Moon Square
.

A Familiar Face
Upon entering
Mt. Moon
, you are immediately approached by
Silver
. He has been doing some self-reflection to find out what he is lacking with his Pokémon, and believes that he has found an answer.
Rival Battle 6
Silver
's team is nearly the same as it was in the previous battle, though his
Haunter
and
Kadabra
have since evolved into
Gengar
and
Alakazam
, respectively. Use super effective moves to target his Pokémon's weaknesses for best results.

in the debris. The Clefairy repeat their dance every Monday night.
