Azalea Town
Azalea Town
Azalea
is a small, isolated town on the south end of
Johto
's peninsula. Due to its remote location between
Union Cave
and
Ilex Forest
, the town sees few visitors aside from those looking to challenge the
Azalea Gym
. A Poké Ball craftsman named
Kurt
lives in the northwest part of town. The
Slowpoke Well
is located in the east, and its resident
Slowpoke
freely wander around town.

Charcoal Kiln
The house in the southeast part of town houses a charcoal kiln. The owner uses a
Farfetch'd
to fell trees in
Ilex Forest
and obtain the necessary materials. The wood is then treated and turned into
Charcoal
, which is then supplied to the local Poké Mart for sale.
Save the Slowpoke!
Visit the northwest house and speak to
Kurt
. If you were looking to have some custom Poké Balls made, it will have to wait. He informs you that members of a criminal organization known as
Team Rocket
have been sighted in
Slowpoke Well
, even though the group was supposedly disbanded
three years ago
. The rumor around town is that they have been cutting off
SlowpokeTails
to sell! Kurt was just about to confront them when you stopped by, and rushes off to save the Pokémon.
Slowpoke Well, B1F
Slowpoke Well, B2F
Slowpoke Well
The
Slowpoke Well
is located on the east side of town, near
Route 33
. The cave is home to the town's
Slowpoke
, which they keep as pets. Legend has it that around 400 years ago, one of the Slowpoke from the well yawned, and in doing so ended a persistent drought that plagued
Azalea Town
.

Kurt
can be found just inside the well, in the southeast corner of B1F. The
Team Rocket Grunt
that was blocking the entrance was so startled when Kurt shouted at him that he fell down the well. Kurt tried to give chase but lost his footing as well, landing hard on his back. He cannot move for the moment, so you need to save the
Slowpoke
in his place. Go north to find and defeat that first Grunt. Climb onto the northeast ridge to battle a female Grunt and pick up the nearby
Super Potion
. Walk down the stairway and go west to fight a third Grunt. Head north past a couple of captive Slowpoke to battle
one final Grunt
, the one in charge of the operation.

Defeated, he admits that
Team Rocket
continued its activities in secret after the order to disband three years ago. He taunts you, saying that now you get to watch them stir up trouble. The Grunts flee, and
Kurt
is on his feet again. After checking on the two
Slowpoke
, he takes you back to his home.
Kurt, the Craftsman
Kurt
would be happy to make custom Poké Balls for you anytime, but he only has one at the moment and gives you a
Lure Ball
as thanks for saving the
Slowpoke
. Kurt goes on to explain that he makes Poké Balls from
Apricorns
; simply collect them from trees and bring them to him. He accepts one Apricorn at a time, and will have the Poké Ball completed the next day. There are seven varieties of Apricorn, each suited for a different type of Poké Ball.
Apricorn

Blk Apricorn
Heavy Ball
More effective against

Pokémon.
Blu Apricorn
Lure Ball

Meant to be more effective against Pokémon of the same species but opposite gender of the active Pokémon.
Due to
a glitch
, it is more effective against same-species, same-gender Pokémon instead.
Red Apricorn
Level Ball
More effective when target's level is lower and active Pokémon's level is higher.
Wht Apricorn
Fast Ball
Meant to be more effective against
Pokémon that run from battle
.
Due to
a glitch
, it is more effective against
Magnemite
,
Grimer
, and
Tangela
, only.
Ylw Apricorn
Moon Ball
Meant to be more effective against Pokémon that evolve by
Moon Stone
.
Due to
a glitch
, it has no additional effect and functions as a normal Poké Ball.
Azalea Gym
Azalea Gym
Azalea Town Pokémon Gym
Leader: Bugsy
The Walking Bug Pokémon Encyclopedia
The
Azalea Gym
specializes in
Bug-type
Pokémon. Bug-type moves are super effective against
Dark
-,
Grass
-, and
Psychic-type
Pokémon, while Bug-type Pokémon are weak to
Fire
-,
Flying
-, and
Rock-type
moves.
The Gym has a simple layout, with a series of bushes arranged in two half-circles around a large tree. The gap near the front of the building is blocked by Twins Amy & May, so challengers must approach from the back of the building to reach the
Gym Leader
.
Neither of
Bugsy
's first two Pokémon are much of a threat, though
Kakuna
may
poison
its target with
Poison Sting
. His
Scyther
is more dangerous, due in part to its high
Attack
and
Speed
. Its
Fury Cutter
attack starts out weak but doubles in power with every successful hit, and deals increased damage to
Grass
Pokémon like
Chikorita
.
Leer
cuts the target's
Defense
, allowing it to deal further damage. Bug Pokémon can do little against the high Defense of
Rock-type
Pokémon; if you traded for the boy's
Onix
in
Violet City
, counterattack with
Rock Throw
for an easy victory.

After the battle,
Bugsy
awards you the
Hive Badge
, which ensures obedience of all Pokémon up to level 30 and enables the use of
Cut
in the field. He also gives you
TM49
(
Fury Cutter
) as a prize.
Ambush!
When you reach the west side of town,
Silver
catches up to you. He asks if it is true that
Team Rocket
has returned, and accuses you of lying after learning that you defeated them. He draws you into battle to force you to prove yourself.
Rival Battle 2
Silver
has added two more Pokémon to his team since the previous battle.
Gastly
takes serious damage from
Ghost
-,
Psychic
-, and
Dark-type
attacks, but its defenses are low enough that attacks of nearly any type will be effective. Ghost Pokémon are immune to
Normal-type
moves, so moves like
Tackle
and
Scratch
are useless.
Zubat
is vulnerable to
Rock
- and
Electric-type
moves, among others. Use the
Onix
from
Violet City
, or a
Mareep
from
Route 32
, for an easy knockout. The Pokémon that he took from
Elm
's lab has evolved since then and learned a move that matches its type, which boosts its power with a
same-type attack bonus
. Avoid pitting your own
first partner Pokémon
against it or risk taking serious damage.

Afterward, he declares his hatred for anything weak, be it human or Pokémon. Silver vows to get stronger and wipe out the weak, including
Team Rocket
. He warns you to stay out of his way before leaving for
Ilex Forest
.
Ilex Forest
Ilex Forest
Ilex Forest
is a densely wooded area between
Azalea Town
and
Route 34
. Trees grow so close together that most sunlight never reaches the forest floor, leaving the area in what seems like perpetual night. A
shrine
dedicated to
the forest's protector
is located a short distance from the southern entrance.

Flight of the Farfetch'd
The apprentice from
Azalea
's Charcoal Kiln can be found a short distance from the southern entrance. He tells you that the
Farfetch'd
that cuts down trees to be turned into
Charcoal
has wandered deeper into the forest. He is too scared of the dark forest to go looking for it, so it is up to you to find Farfetch'd. The Pokémon is startled easily, and approaching it from the wrong direction will only chase it deeper into the forest.
Go east to find the Pokémon and interact with it, causing it to run off northward. Instead of following it, go east and circle around behind it to chase it back to the apprentice. He thanks you for your help, explaining that
Farfetch'd
will not listen to him as he has no
Badges
. Speak to his boss to receive
HM01
(
Cut
) as thanks for saving his business. Teach this field move to a compatible Pokémon and use it to remove the small tree nearby, clearing a path forward. If you return to the Charcoal Kiln, the apprentice will reward you with a piece of
Charcoal
.
Shake, Rattle, and Roll
Southeast of the pond, there is a man standing atop a ledge, facing a small pine tree. He explains that he has been shaking trees with
Headbutt
, and invites you to try it as well before giving you
TM02
(
Headbutt
). This field move allows Trainers to shake these
small trees
, which sometimes causes a wild Pokémon to fall out. Depending on the time of day, the Pokémon that appears may be
asleep
. There are
several
Pokémon
species
that can only be encountered this way.

Pokémon Day Care
The
Pokémon Day Care
is run by an elderly couple. The center allows Trainers to leave up to two of their Pokémon to be raised by the couple. Any Pokémon left in their care earns one
experience point
for every step you take. It costs a flat rate of
$
100, plus another
$
100 for every level gained, to withdraw a Pokémon.
If a
compatible
male and female are left here at the same time, you may return to discover that the elderly couple has found an
Egg
. Keep the Egg in your party, like with the
Mystery Egg
, and it will eventually hatch. The Pokémon that appears will be the lowest species in the evolutionary line of the mother. If either parent is unavailable,
Ditto
may be used as a substitute; in this case, the newly-hatched Pokémon will be the lowest species in the evolutionary line of the non-Ditto parent. This is the only way to obtain additional members of a certain species, like
Eevee
, and newly-discovered
baby Pokémon
, like
Pichu
.
