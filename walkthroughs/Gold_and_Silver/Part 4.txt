Ruins of Alph
The grounds where the
Ruins of Alph
are located can be reached from
Route 32
to the east and
Route 36
to the north. There are four interior chambers. Each chamber holds a puzzle in which tiles must be arranged to show the image of a specific Pokémon species. Completing each puzzle causes a series of
Unown
forms to begin appearing in the large hall beneath the complex. The mysterious Pokémon species appears in
many different forms
that all resemble letters of the alphabet.
Unown
's encounter rate is divided among all unlocked forms. Once all forms have been unlocked, most will have an encounter rate of 3.9%. Due to the method used to determine its form, Unown Z will always be slightly less common than the others, at 2.3%.

North chamber
The north chamber is the only one accessible at first. A bit of text beside the puzzle hints at the Pokémon's identity. Move the tiles to their proper place to reveal the Pokémon's image and complete the puzzle. Doing so causes the floor to fall away, dropping you into the underground hall where the first eleven forms of
Unown
have awakened.
Catch at least three different forms, and a Scientist investigating the ruins will approach you upon exiting the hall. He leads you to a nearby research facility and upgrades your Pokédex with its
Unown Mode
, allowing it to record the limited data available on each of the Unown forms.

Quick! It's Qwilfish!
Halfway through the route, there is a pier with three Fishermen. Once you defeat Fisher Ralph, be sure to trade phone numbers with him. He will call occasionally to alert you about a
swarm
of a certain Pokémon species.
Qwilfish
are usually difficult to find, but will be more likely to appear along
Route 32
for a short time. The swarm only lasts until midnight, so be quick!
Scheming for SlowpokeTails
As you approach the southern end of the route, you are stopped by a shady man to the west of the Pokémon Center. He tries to sell you a "tasty, nutritious
SlowpokeTail
" for the special price of
$
1,000,000. When he realizes that you do not have the cash, he shooes you away.
Fishing Guru 1
Visit the Pokémon Center to rest your weary team and prepare for the upcoming cave. Speak to the Fisherman near the counter to receive an
Old Rod
. With this
fishing
rod, you can now cast your line at any body of water to reel in
Water-type
Pokémon. The Old Rod is a low-end model, and is often only able to hook
Magikarp
.
Union Cave

Union Cave, B1F
Union Cave, B2F
Union Cave
is a small cave on the southern end of
Johto
's peninsula, located between Routes
32
and
33
. The ground-level tunnel simply connects the two routes together. Seawater wells up from underground in several areas, initially blocking access to the deepest parts of the cave. Exploring the lower levels at a later point reveals two more exits that lead back to the
Ruins of Alph
.
