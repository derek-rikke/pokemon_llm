Cianwood City
Cianwood City
Cianwood City
is a small, seaside town on a separate landmass to the southwest of mainland
Johto
. Despite its distance, many Trainers still brave the waters of Routes
40
and
41
to challenge the
Cianwood Gym
, or to visit
a centuries-old pharmacy
known for its unique medicine.

Cianwood City Pharmacy
The
Cianwood City Pharmacy
is located on the south side of town, and has served as the local Poké Mart for the last 500 years. Inform the shopkeeper of the situation in
Olivine Lighthouse
to receive the
SecretPotion
, a powerful remedy only dispensed in emergencies.
After dispensing the SecretPotion, the shopkeeper offers traditional medicine for sale.

Then There was One
The house in the middle of town belongs to a PokéManiac. Speak to him to learn that he was bullied by someone with "
piercing eyes and long hair
" into giving up one of his Pokémon. He still has one left, but is afraid of what will happen if the thief returns. He asks that you take his remaining Pokémon, a
Shuckle
, for safekeeping.
He will eventually ask for his Shuckle back, but will decide to let you keep it if it has grown
friendly
enough toward you.
Cianwood Gym
Cianwood Gym
Cianwood City Pokémon Gym
Leader: Chuck
His Roaring Fists Do The Talking
The
Cianwood Gym
specializes in
Fighting-type
Pokémon. Fighting-type moves are super effective against
Dark
-,
Ice
-,
Normal
-,
Rock
-, and
Steel-type
Pokémon, while Fighting-type Pokémon are weak to
Flying
- and
Psychic-type
moves.
There are three Gym Trainers stationed in the first part of the Gym. The first two stand facing each other from opposite sides, and must be fought in quick succession. After defeating a third, challengers must use
Strength
to move three boulders and clear a path. At this point, one final Gym Trainer must be defeated to reach the
Gym Leader
.
Chuck
's
Primeape
has a high
Attack
stat, allowing it to deal considerable damage already. Using
Leer
cuts the foe's
Defense
, making it even more dangerous. His
Poliwrath
can lull the target to
sleep
with
Hypnosis
, but the combination of
Mind Reader
and
DynamicPunch
is something to be avoided at all costs. DynamicPunch is one of the strongest Fighting-type moves, and is guaranteed to cause
Confusion
if it hits. It has only 50%
Accuracy
on its own, but Mind Reader ensures the next move will connect with its target. As a
Water
Pokémon, it is also vulnerable to
Grass
- and
Electric-type
moves. Healing items like
Awakening
and
Bitter Berry
will be helpful, as will using moves like
Reflect
to boost your Pokémon's
Defense
.

After the battle,
Chuck
awards you the
Storm Badge
, which ensures obedience of all Pokémon up to level 70 and enables the use of
Fly
in the field. He also gives you
TM01
(
DynamicPunch
) as a prize.
Fly Like a Bird
With
Chuck
defeated, speak to
Chuck's wife
in front of the Gym. Hearing that you had to cross the sea to get here, she remarks how much easier it would be if your Pokémon knew how to fly. After noticing your new
Storm Badge
, the woman gives you
HM02
(
Fly
). This field move allows a Trainer to quickly return to any familiar location. She comments how it is a good thing that her husband was defeated, as it gives him a reason to train.
Photo Studio
The Photo Studio is located on the north side of town. By speaking to the man inside, Trainers may have pictures taken of their party members, one at a time. This is meant to work with the
Game Boy Printer
peripheral. The
player
can print out their
Pokédex
or the
stats
of one specific Pokémon.
Mail
can also be printed.

to

Amphy
, and seeing it restored to full health, promises to return to the
Olivine Gym
.
Olivine Gym
Olivine Gym
Olivine City Pokémon Gym
Leader: Jasmine
The Steel-Clad Defense Girl
The
Olivine Gym
specializes in
Steel-type
Pokémon. Steel-type moves are super effective against
Ice
- and
Rock-type
Pokémon, while Steel-type Pokémon are weak to
Fighting
-,
Fire
-, and
Ground-type
moves.
The Gym features neither puzzles to solve nor Gym Trainers to defeat, allowing challengers to reach the
Gym Leader
immediately.
Both of
Jasmine
's two
Magnemite
can harass their target with
Supersonic
and
Thunder Wave
, though
Ground-type
Pokémon are immune to the latter. Her
Steelix
is vulnerable to
Fire
attacks as well, but can retaliate with
Rock Throw
against unsuspecting Fire Pokémon.
Screech
lowers the target's
Defense
, while
Iron Tail
may do the same. Its low
Special Defense
leaves it particularly vulnerable to Fire- and
Water-type
attacks.

Having now explored western
Johto
, the next destination is the region's mountainous northeast area. Fly back to
Ecruteak City
and head east to reach
Route 42
.
Route 42
Route 42
Route 42
connects
Ecruteak City
to
Mahogany Town
in the east. The path runs along the base of
Mt. Mortar
, and is divided twice over by small lakes. Crossing these waters directly requires the use of
Surf
, but it is possible to detour through the mountain to avoid them. A grove of
Apricorn
trees grows in the middle of the route.
