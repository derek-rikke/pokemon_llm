Stop, Thief!
The man dressed in black can be found regrouping on Nugget Bridge. He identifies himself as a member of
Team Rocket
, and that his secret mission was to disable the
Power Plant
's generator in order to cause mass panic. He makes you a deal: defeat him in battle, and he will reveal where he hid the stolen part.
After the battle, he reveals that he hid the
Machine Part
in the waters of
Cerulean Gym
, and tells you to search the area in the middle. He shrugs off his loss, saying that his Team Rocket friends will come from
Johto
to get revenge for him, but quickly flees when he realizes that no help is coming.
Cerulean City
Cerulean Gym
Sunken Treasure
The
Gym Leader
has stepped out for the moment and there are no Gym Trainers around. Search the waters in the enclosed part of the walkway to recover the
Machine Part
.
Route 10 (North)
Kanto Power Plant
Power Restored!
Return to the
Power Plant
and speak to the manager to deliver the
Machine Part
. He is grateful to see it returned, and rewards you with
TM07
(
Zap Cannon
).
With the generator restored and the Power Plant back online, there are certain sidequests that may now be completed.
Saffron City
Copycat's house
Return to
Saffron City
and visit the
Copycat
's house in the northwest part of the city. Speak to her to learn that she has lost her favorite
Poké Doll
, and believes it to be located somewhere in
Vermilion City
.
Vermilion City
Pokémon Fan Club
Return to
Vermilion City
and visit the Pokémon Fan Club on the west side of town. Speak to the man with the
Clefairy
Poké Doll
to explain the situation. He has not yet been able to catch his own Clefairy, and brought a doll that he had found instead. When he realizes that it is missed by its owner, he gladly gives up the
Lost Item
.
Saffron City
Magnet Train station
Copycat's house
Speak to the girl to return the
Lost Item
. She rewards you with a
Pass
, a ticket used to board the
Magnet Train
. Her old home was torn down to make room for the train station, and she received the item from a train company representative as compensation. Now that the Power Plant is operational again, the Magnet Train runs between
Johto
's
Goldenrod City
and
Kanto
's
Saffron City
twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. As the
S.S. Aqua
sails only on certain days, riding the train is the most convenient means of travel between the two regions.
Lavender Town
Radio Tower
Return to
Lavender Town
's Radio Tower and speak to the manager near the north wall. With the power back on and the tower broadcasting normally, he never lost his job. Realizing that it is you that he has to thank for this, he rewards you with an
EXPN Card
. This expansion card allows the
Pokégear
to tune into the remaining radio program, the Poké Flute Channel, on Channel 20.0.
Route 25
Route 25
Route 25
leads eastward from
Route 24
. The path winds its way through a forest before it ends overlooking the sea. The
Sea Cottage
is located on the east side.

Misty
before heading back to town.

Cerulean City Pokémon Gym
Leader: Misty
The Tomboyish Mermaid
The
Cerulean Gym
specializes in
Water-type
Pokémon. Water-type moves are super effective against
Fire
-,
Ground
-, and
Rock-type
Pokémon, while Water-type Pokémon are weak to
Electric
- and
Grass-type
moves.
The Gym features a large swimming pool, with an elevated walkway that leads to the back of the building. At least two of the three Gym Trainers must be defeated in order to reach the
Gym Leader
.
Electric-type
attacks are a major vulnerability for
Misty
's team. Only the
Ground-type
Quagsire
is unaffected by Electric moves, and can deal increased damage to Electric Pokémon with
Earthquake
. If
Rain Dance
takes effect,
Water
moves receive a power boost and
Thunder
has its
Accuracy
increased to 100%.
Grass-type
moves will do equally well, but both
Lapras
and
Starmie
can counter Grass Pokémon with their
Ice
attacks. Alternatively, Lapras takes serious damage from
Fighting
- and
Rock-type
moves, while Starmie falters against
Bug
-,
Ghost
-, and
Dark-type
moves.
