The Pushy Salesman
There is a man on the east side of town that stops anyone from reaching
Route 44
. He states that as you are new in town, you should definitely try a
RageCandyBar
for the low price of
$
300. The item is a local specialty, named for the nearby
Lake of Rage
. Its cost, and its effect when used, are identical to that of a
Potion
.
The Shady Sightseer
A second man blocks the entrance to the
Mahogany Gym
as well. He says that you should take the time for some sightseeing, and tells you to check out the
Lake of Rage
. The lake is located to the north, beyond
Route 43
.
Route 43
Route 43
Route 43
connects
Mahogany Town
to the
Lake of Rage
. The main road passes through a gate, while a grassy trail winds its way through the trees.

The Greedy Guards
Travelers who wish to take the easier path to the lake and stay on the main road are forced to pass through the gate.
Team Rocket
knows this, and has dispatched two Grunts here. Anyone who enters the gate is immediately confronted by the pair, and forced to pay
$
1,000 as a toll. They mention how their assignment has been very profitable, as everyone wants to see whatever is happening at the
Lake of Rage
.
Lake of Rage
Lake of Rage
The
Lake of Rage
, also known as
Gyarados
Lake, is the largest lake in
Johto
. According to a local Fishing Guru, the lake was created when rampaging Gyarados altered the landscape and the resulting crater eventually filled with rainwater. The lake has not been the same since
the men dressed in black
appeared, and there have even been sightings of a
strangely-colored Gyarados
.

Peace Disturbed
Something has been disturbing the Pokémon living in the lake, and now the
Gyarados
are angry. One of them can be seen just offshore. Unlike others of its species, this individual seems to have evolved under mysterious circumstances that resulted in its
unusual coloring
. It will not calm itself, so it must be caught or defeated.
VS Gyarados
As a
Water
/
Flying
-type Pokémon,
Gyarados
is vulnerable to
Electric
- and
Rock-type
attacks. Using these moves first will wear it down quickly. Follow up with
Fire

moves to further chip away at its health.

When the battle ends, you find a

floating on the water. Climb back onto shore and speak to the man reading the sign. He has been investigating rumors that all of the
Magikarp
in the lake are being forced to evolve prematurely. He introduces himself as
Lance
, and asks for your help. He believes that a mysterious radio signal originating in
Mahogany Town
is the cause, and sets off to find the source.
Mahogany Town
Souvenir Shop
Upon entering the shady shop, you see
Lance
's
Dragonite
using
Hyper Beam
to attack one of the workers. Lance confirms that the strange radio signal is coming from this location, and pushes past the shopkeeper to reveal a hidden stairway leading underground.

Continue west and take the first doorway to head south. Defeat Scientist Jed in the interior room, then grab the

Lance
is waiting for you here, and heals your Pokémon before continuing on. The nearby door needs a password to open, so continue eastward to fight another two Rocket Grunts. Take the stairs down to the lowest floor.
B3F (Southeast)
Lance
informs you that reaching the boss requires two passwords, which are only known by a few trusted Rockets. Pick up the
Protein
near the east wall, then battle Scientist Ross and the female Rocket Grunt in the eastern room. Defeated, she gives up the first password: "
SlowpokeTail
". Move on to the southwest room to fight Scientist Mitch, then defeat another Rocket Grunt to learn the second password: "
RaticateTail
." Collect the
Dire Hit
and
Full Heal
near the potted plants, then head north. Pick up the
Ice Heal
near the north wall, then climb the northeast stairs.
B2F (North)
Head all the way to the west, where you are challenged by another Rocket Grunt. Go down the stairs to reach the boss's room.
B3F (Northwest)
When you approach the executive's room,
Silver
appears. He insists that he will be the one to eliminate
Team Rocket
, then runs off. Before opening the door, climb the southern stairs to a separate area of B2F.
B2F (West)
Pick up the item,
TM46
(
Thief
), then go back downstairs.
B3F (Northwest)
Examine the door to enter the two passwords, and the door opens. The Rocket Executive inside demands to know who you are and why you are in
Giovanni
's office. He reveals that Giovanni disappeared after disbanding
Team Rocket
three years ago
, but that the group has continued on since then, planning for his eventual return.

Afterward, she claims that their broadcasting experiment is a success, despite their defeat here. They are unconcerned what happens to their hideout, as they apparently have bigger plans.
Team Rocket
flees the building, and
Lance
inspects the generator. He cannot find a power switch, and determines that to shut it down, the six
Electrode
that power it must be removed. The two of you split the task, so catch or defeat the three on the left side to put an end to Team Rocket's plan.

Mahogany Gym
Mahogany Gym
Mahogany Town Pokémon Gym
Leader: Pryce
The Teacher of Winter's Harshness
The
Mahogany Gym
specializes in
Ice-type
Pokémon. Ice-type moves are super effective against
Dragon
-,
Flying
-,
Grass
-, and
Ground-type
Pokémon, while Ice-type Pokémon are weak to
Fighting
-,
Fire
-,
Rock
-, and
Steel-type
moves.
The Gym is filled with slippery, ice-like tiles. When stepped on, the challenger is sent sliding until they reach a patch of normal flooring or some other obstacle. Begin by standing between the left Poké Ball statue and the interior wall, then move northward twice to reach Boarder Douglas. Slide to the east, then south to stop behind the Poké Ball statue on the right. Move westward, then northward again to stop next to Boarder Doulgas again. Slide eastward one last time to reach the
Gym Leader
.
Pryce
's
Seel
is vulnerable to
Grass
- and
Electric-type
moves. Despite being a
Water-type
Pokémon, it can still fight back against unsuspecting Grass Pokémon with
Ice
attacks. His
Dewgong
is much the same, but also takes serious damage from
Rock
- and
Fighting-type
moves. His
Piloswine
can use
Blizzard
, the strongest
Ice-type
attack, but its
Ice
/
Ground
typing leaves it with the most weaknesses of Pryce's team, with five: Fighting-,
Steel
-,
Fire
-,
Water
-, and Grass-type moves.

After the battle,

Special Attack
and
Special Defense
boost during battle and enables the use of

TM16
(
Icy Wind
) as a prize.
Desperate Times
Upon leaving the Gym, you receive a call from
Professor Elm
. He informs you of strange radio broadcasts that mention
Team Rocket
. It seems that the group has one more card to play, so hurry back to
Goldenrod City
's
Radio Tower
to finally put a stop to their plans.
