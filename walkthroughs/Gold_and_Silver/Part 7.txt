Spearow
, named Kenya, and the piece of
Mail
it holds to his friend on
Route 31

Nightmare
). Return here and speak to the guard afterward to receive an
HP Up
as a reward.

Defeat Bug Catcher Arnie near the
thin tree
in the northeast, then be sure to trade phone numbers with him. He will call occasionally to alert you about a
swarm
of a certain Pokémon species.
Yanma

Route 35
for a short time. The swarm only lasts until midnight, so be quick!

Bug-Catching Contest
There is no entry fee for the
Bug-Catching Contest
. Anyone may enter once per day, every
Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday
.
To compete, Trainers must catch the single best
Bug-type
Pokémon they can find. To do this, Trainers are given 20
Park Balls
and are only allowed to use a single Pokémon from their party. The others remain with the contest officials until the competition is over. Any Pokémon caught will be recorded in the Pokédex, but only one Pokémon may be kept to be judged. The Pokémon selected to be judged may be kept after the competition.
The competition ends when 20 minutes have passed, all
Park Balls
have been used, or the Trainer
blacks out
, leaves the park, or chooses to quit. After that, the judging will occur, in which Trainers are scored on their skills of capturing rare and powerful Pokémon.
