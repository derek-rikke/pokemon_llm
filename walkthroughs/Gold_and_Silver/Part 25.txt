Viridian Gym
The
Viridian Gym
is located on a hill on the north side of town. The building is open, but no one is around. According to an elderly man outside the entrance, the Gym did not have a
Gym Leader
until recently, when
a young man
from
Pallet Town
took the role. He is often away, however, so challenging the Viridian Gym will need to wait.
Trainer House
Trainer House, 1F
Trainer House, B1F
The
Trainer House
is located in the middle of the city. Built near
Indigo Plateau
, the ultimate destination for Pokémon Trainers, the Trainer House allows participants to battle in a controlled environment. According to visitors inside the building, the best Trainers gather here. These Trainers turn out to be real-life friends of the player, whose own parties are submitted to the game through
Mystery Gift
. If the player has not used Mystery Gift, the default opponent is
Cal
, whose team includes the final forms of each of
Professor Elm's Pokémon
. Only one battle may be conducted per day.

Red's house
The northwest house belongs to
Red
and
his mother
, but Red is currently away. He defeated his neighbor and
rival
,
Blue
, to earn the Champion title, but gave up that role within the
Pokémon League
in order to continue his training. His mother is proud of him, but still worries that he is all alone somewhere.
Blue's house
The northeast house belongs to
Blue
and his sister,
Daisy
, but Blue is away as well. She reveals that her brother serves as the
Viridian City
Gym Leader
, and that his frequent traveling causes problems for the Gym's challengers.
Spa Day with Daisy
Speak to
Daisy
between 3:00 PM and 4:00 PM, and she offers to groom a single Pokémon. Grooming increases a Pokémon's
friendship
rating, and boosting this value is essential in order to obtain
certain Pokémon
. Daisy offers her grooming service once per day.
Professor Oak's Lab
The large building to the south is
Professor Oak
's
laboratory
. Speak with the professor to have him rate your
Pokédex
progress. He also asks that you visit again after earning all eight
Kanto
Gym Badges, as he will have a gift for you.
