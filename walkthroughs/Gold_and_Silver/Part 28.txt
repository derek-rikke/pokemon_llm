The first chamber is the only part of the cave that is dark enough that
Flash
is usable. Grab the
Protein
from the southeast ridge, then jump the ledge to the west to pick up an
Escape Rope
. Go north and walk along the C-shaped ridge to reach the center of the chamber. The northern-most ridge becomes a three-way intersection; take the western path to get a
Max Elixer
, then turn east and walk through the cave opening into the next chamber.
2F
Surf
out into the water to the west, then use
Waterfall
. Climb onto the ridge and enter the cave opening to find a small, dead-end chamber with a
Max Revive
. Back in the main chamber, climb up the three stairways and continue northward along the rocky ridge. Pass by the north-central cave opening, then climb the second waterfall to reach the northeast area. The second dead-end tunnel holds a
Full Restore
. Sail back westward and enter the final cave opening.
Summit
Cross over the rocky land bridge to finally meet
Red
, former Champion of the
Kanto
region. He and his Pokémon have been in training here since he gave up his Champion title, and that training has resulted in each of his Pokémon reaching sky-high levels. Even with a type advantage, Red's Pokémon will not go down without a fight.
VS Red
Red
leads with his
Pikachu
, which has already grown to level 81. Its powerful
Electric-type
attacks will inflict a great deal of damage to an unprepared target, but it is still vulnerable to
Ground-type
moves, like
Earthquake
. His
Espeon
is dangerous for any Pokémon with low
Special Defense
, so hit it with
Bug
-,
Ghost
-, or
Dark-type
attacks to knock it out quickly.
Snorlax
can restore its health with
Rest
, and even attack while asleep with
Snore
.
Amnesia
boosts its Special Defense, but
Fighting-type
attacks, its only weakness, are classified as
physical moves
anyway.
Venusaur
's
Sunny Day
lets it recover even more health with
Synthesis
and launch
SolarBeam
without charging. A
Grass-type
Pokémon, it fares poorly in extreme heat or cold, so use
Fire
and
Ice
moves to wear it down. His
Charizard
takes massive damage from
Rock-type
attacks, but is also vulnerable to
Water
and Electric moves. Finally, his
Blastoise
falters against Grass and Electric attacks, but can retaliate against Grass Pokémon with
Blizzard
.

After the battle,
Red
pauses for a moment in stunned silence. Then, in the blink of an eye, he disappears. He is not gone for good though, as defeating the Elite Four and Champion again will cause him to reappear here. The credits roll for the second time, and you resume your adventure in front of the
Mt. Silver
Pokémon Center.
Having scaled the mountain and defeated the legendary Trainer, the final remaining task is to complete the Pokédex.
Pokémon Gold and Silver
brought the total number of Pokémon up to 251, so there is plenty of training left to do!
