Lavender Town
Lavender Town
Soul House, Interior
Lavender Town
is a quiet, somber town. The area
was once
known for its common ghost sightings in
Pokémon Tower
, where departed Pokémon were laid to rest. In an attempt to modernize, the town converted the building in recent years into the Kanto Radio Tower. The Pokémon interred here were moved to the Soul House in the southeast part of town, where they remain under the watchful eye of
Mr. Fuji
.
Kanto Radio Tower
The Kanto Radio Tower has been on high alert ever since
Johto
's
Radio Tower
was taken over by
Team Rocket
, and visitors are now restricted to the first floor. The Pokégear can detect two of the three programs broadcasted from here on its own, but tuning into the third one requires an
EXPN Card
.
