Goldenrod City
Goldenrod City
is a sprawling metropolis located in western
Johto
, between Routes
34
and
35
. It is the region's largest city, and a major hub of economy and telecommunications. The
Goldenrod Department Store
offers a wide variety of goods, and
an underground shopping district
has its own selection. The
Radio Tower
broadcasts several informative programs, while patrons aim to hit the jackpot at the local
Game Corner
. A
bicycle shop
has recently moved here from
Kanto
, while the high-speed
Magnet Train
links the two neighboring regions. The
Goldenrod Gym
can be found in the northeast part of the city, next to a flower shop.

A Mysterious Gift
A little girl dressed in green
can be found near the stairs. Speaking to her unlocks the
Mystery Gift
function, which is used to communicate with other Mystery Gift-enabled games to obtain random
room decorations
or items.
Time for a Trade
A man dressed in blue near the counter would like to
trade
Pokémon. He is willing to part with his
Machop
in exchange for a
Drowzee
. Drowzee can be found just outside
Goldenrod City
, on Routes
34
and
35
.
An Intriguing Impression
On Sundays, a second vendor appears behind the counter. Speak to her, and she will assess how your lead Pokémon feels about you. If it is
friendly
toward you, she hands out
TM27
(
Return
) as a reward. If not, she gives out
TM21
(
Frustration
) instead. She hands out only one TM each week.

Friendship checker
The house to the northeast of the department store belongs to a woman who can evaluate the
friendliness
of the first Pokémon in your party. There are
certain Pokémon
that can only be acquired when a Pokémon is happy with its Trainer. There are
many things
that can be done in order to deepen a Pokémon's friendship with its Trainer, like
grooming
it or feeding it
vitamins
.
Bike Shop
Bike Shop, interior
The
Bike Shop
has recently moved to the city's southeast neighborhood from the
Kanto
region, but is having trouble attracting customers. Recognizing the great deal of traveling you will be doing as a Pokémon Trainer, the owner asks to loan you a
Bicycle
. His hope is that others will see you riding one of his bikes and be interested enough to visit his shop. He takes down your contact information, and soon you have a brand new Bicycle. Riding a bike is faster than traveling on foot, and the owner gains new customers—everybody wins!
Sometime later, you receive a call from the owner. He says that business is better now that people have seen you with one of his Bikes, and lets you keep the one he lent you to show his thanks.
Magnet Train Station
The
Magnet Train
station is located in the northwest part of the city. The high-speed train links Goldenrod City to
Saffron City
, in the middle of the neighboring
Kanto
region. With a
Pass
, it is normally possible for visitors to board the train at any time. However, it seems to be running late and has not yet returned from its latest journey into Kanto.
Goldenrod Radio Tower
The
Goldenrod Radio Tower
stands tall in the northwest part of the city. It is the source of all
Pokégear
broadcasts in
Johto
. Visitors are allowed on the first and second floors, while the upper floors are restricted to authorized personnel only.

Radio Tower, 1F
Lucky Number Lottery
One of the radio programs produced here, the
Lucky Number Show
, announces a random, five-digit number every week. Speak to the man behind the counter to have him check this week's number against the
ID Numbers
of your Pokémon, and if any of these numbers are a full or partial match, you win a prize.

Bill's house
The house to the southwest of the Game Corner is home to a woman and her daughter. They are relatives of
Bill
, the inventor of the
Pokémon Storage System
. His mother reveals that he is currently away on business at the Pokémon Center in
Ecruteak City
. Since you are using his storage system, his sister gives you his phone number. Giving Bill a call is a convenient way to learn how many Pokémon are stored in the current PC box.
After meeting him in Ecruteak, he returns home to
Goldenrod
. Stop by his house afterwards to receive a
gift
from him.
The Underground
The Underground
An
underground passage
connects the southwest and northwest parts of the city, with a small access hallway leading to the basement of the Department Store. It contains a bargain shop that sells
valuable items
, a
Pokémon salon
, and
a shop selling herbal medicine
. Each has set hours of operation and all three are never open at the same time.

friendship
rating. This shop is only open on weekends.

friendship
with its Trainer, though at different rates. The younger and less experienced brother is available on Sundays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and charges
$
300. The older and more experienced brother is available on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, and charges
$
500. Their shop is closed on Mondays.
Bargain shop
The northern booth houses a bargain shop, which is only open on Mondays from 4:00 am to 9:00 am. This merchant deals in valuable items; while having no use themselves, they can be resold elsewhere for decent profit. Only one of each item may be purchased per week.

Name Rater
The house near the city's north exit belongs to the
Name Rater
. Here, Trainers can have the
nicknames
of their Pokémon rated and, if the Pokémon's
ID number
matches the
Trainer's ID number
, the nickname can be changed. If the Pokémon was caught by the Trainer that currently owns it, he says that the name could be better and offers the chance to change it. If the Pokémon was obtained via a
trade
, he says that the name is perfect and refuses to change it.
Goldenrod Gym
Goldenrod Gym
Goldenrod City Pokémon Gym
Leader: Whitney
The Incredibly Pretty Girl!
The
Goldenrod Gym
specializes in
Normal-type
Pokémon. Normal-type moves are not super-effective against any Pokémon, while Normal-type Pokémon are weak to
Fighting-type
moves.
The Gym is filled with planters of bushes and flowers arranged in the shape of a
Clefairy
. Moving clockwise along the exterior wall, it is possible to bypass Beauty Victoria in the northwest corner and reach the interior area. Moving counter-clockwise instead, challengers must defeat Beauty Samantha in the northeast to continue onward. Two more Trainers must then be defeated to reach the
Gym Leader
.
Whitney
's
Clefairy
may not be much of a problem on its own, but there is always a chance that using
Metronome
calls a powerful attack if luck is on its side. The more pressing threat is her
Miltank
. It has high
Defense
and
Speed
, and can restore its health with
Milk Drink
. Its most dangerous move is
Rollout
, which doubles in power for each consecutive hit. The easiest way to oppose the Goldenrod Gym is to bring the
Machop
available for
trade
in the Department Store. Its
Fighting-type
moves will deal serious damage to Whitney's Pokémon, and Miltank's Rollout is not very effective against Fighting-type Pokémon.

After the battle,
Whitney
sobs uncontrollably. Unable to claim your new Badge, you turn to leave when Lass Bridget steps in. According to her, Whitney always cries when she loses, but will compose herself soon. Speak to Whitney again, and she finally awards you the
Plain Badge
, which gives your Pokémon a slight
Speed
boost during battle and enables the use of
Strength
in the field. She also gives out
TM45
(
Attract
) as a prize.
Goldenrod Flower Shop
Before you leave for
Route 35
, be sure to stop by the flower shop to the east-northeast of the Gym. The two women inside talk about an
odd tree
on
Route 36
that actually squirms around to avoid contact with water. One woman gives you a
SquirtBottle
so that you can see for yourself.
