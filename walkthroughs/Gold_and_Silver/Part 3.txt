in exchange for a

Earl's Pokémon Academy
The local
Pokémon academy
is run by a man named
Earl Dervish
, who is initially found standing between the Gym and Poké Mart. Speak to him, and he asks if you have defeated the local Gym; say no, and he leads you to the school while he twirls around at every turn along the way. The school teaches inexperienced Trainers about the basics of battle. A blackboard in the front of the room describes the five status ailments that can affect a Pokémon.

Sprout Tower
Sprout Tower
is a large pagoda held together by a flexible pillar that sways from side to side. This flexibility protects the tower from earthquakes and symbolizes the battles occurring on the upper floors. It is inhabited by Sages who study diligently and teach that all living beings coexist through cooperation. It is said that the swaying pillar was once a 100-foot-tall

1F (Center)
The tower is three stories tall. The ground floor is open to tourists, who visit to see the unique style in which the tower is built. Pass by the swaying pillar and climb the stairs to 2F.
2F (Northeast)
Go east to battle Sage Nico and take the stairs back down to 1F.
1F (North)
Pick up the
Parlyz Heal
to the south. Head west to battle Sage Chow, then climb up the western stairway.
2F (Southwest)
Grab the
X Defend
to the north, then battle Sage Edmond in the southwest corner. Climb the southern stairway to 3F.
3F
Collect the
Potion
to the west. Continue northward to battle Sages Jin, Neal, and Troy.
When you pass the swaying pillar, you find that
Silver
has just defeated the elder Sage, Li. He acknowledges Silver's skill as a Pokémon Trainer and hands him a
Hidden Machine
, but warns that he should not treat his Pokémon so harshly. Silver notices you at this point, and complains about the elder Sage being weak. He clearly has no intention of heeding the Sage's warning, as he is only interested in strong Pokémon that can win. He then uses an Escape Rope to leave the tower.
Pick up the
Escape Rope
in the northeast corner, then speak to Sage Li. He welcomes you to the tower, and offers to test the bonds between you and your Pokémon.
VS Sage Li
Li's two
Bellsprout
can both boost their
Special Attack
with
Growth
, which lets them deal extra damage with
Vine Whip
.
Grass-type
Pokémon like these are vulnerable to
Fire
- and
Flying-type
attacks, so
Pidgey
,
Hoothoot
, and
Cyndaquil
will have little trouble getting past them. His Hoothoot, a Flying-type Pokémon, takes serious damage from
Rock-type
attacks.

When the battle is over, Li rewards you with
HM05
(
Flash
). This field move lights up even the darkest caves, but to use it outside of battle, you must first defeat the
Violet Gym
.
Violet Gym
Violet Gym
Violet City Pokémon Gym
Leader: Falkner
The Elegant Master of Flying Pokémon
The
Violet Gym
specializes in
Flying-type
Pokémon. Flying-type moves are super effective against
Bug
-,
Fighting
-, and
Grass-type
Pokémon, while Flying-type Pokémon are weak to
Electric
-,
Ice
-, and
Rock-type
moves.
The Gym has a simple layout, and features a winding walkway that passes over a seemingly bottomless pit. There are two Gym Trainers that must be defeated in order to reach the
Gym Leader
.
Both of
Falkner
's Pokémon can use
Mud-Slap
, a
Ground-type
attack that lowers the target's
Accuracy
. Despite its low power, it still deals increased damage to
Fire
Pokémon like
Cyndaquil
. His
Pidgeotto
's
Gust
attack does well against
Bug
Pokémon, and
Grass-type
Pokémon like
Chikorita
. Flying Pokémon can do little against the high
Defense
of
Rock-type
Pokémon; if you traded for the boy's
Onix
, counterattack with
Rock Throw
for an easy victory.

After the battle,
Falkner
awards you the
Zephyr Badge
, which gives your Pokémon a slight
Attack
boost during battle and enables the use of
Flash
in the field. He also gives you
TM31
(
Mud-Slap
) as a prize.
Elm and the Egg
Professor Elm
calls when you step outside the Gym, and says that they have discovered something about the
Mystery Egg
. He informs you that his aide is in the nearby Pokémon Center, and asks that you pay him a visit.
Pokémon Center
Elm
's aide is waiting for you near the counter. Speak to him to receive a message from the professor, asking that you take the
Mystery Egg
. The aide explains that in order for a Pokémon to grow and hatch from an Egg, it must spend time with other active Pokémon. He asks that you call the professor when it hatches, then leaves.
