When you reappear in your room, your partner happily gifts you the
Small Bouquet
it made. As you attempt to go downstairs,
Trace
rushes into your room with rumors of a strong-looking Pokémon spotted near a cave in
Cerulean City
. He intends to make it a competition between the two of you, and whoever catches the Pokémon first wins.
A World Expands
Stepping outside, you realize that your world has expanded after becoming Champion. The coveted title brings new privileges, so you can now fly through the sky on
Charizard
,
Aerodactyl
, or
Dragonite
whenever you like! This allows you to encounter other
Flying-type
Pokémon high in the skies, and also lets you bypass areas that require
Chop Down
or
Sea Skim
.
As you reach this realization, a Youngster calls out to you. He reintroduces himself as Ronny from
Route 1
, and informs you that
Master Trainers
have now appeared all throughout
Kanto
. These elite Trainers have spent their entire careers training one specific Pokémon species, and will not be easy to defeat! There are 153 of them to find, and they can be identified by their red clothes and the speech bubble above their head that shows their chosen Pokémon. When battling them, you may only use a single Pokémon and it must be the same as theirs. Their Pokémon are high-leveled and well-trained, so defeating them all will not be easy.

Cerulean City
There is only one place left to explore:
Cerulean Cave
, a mysterious place on the northwest edge of
Cerulean City
. To get there, visitors may use
Sea Skim
to sail southward from
Route 24
, or simply fly over the water with a
Flying-type
Pokémon. The Coach Trainer who had initially blocked entry to the cave has moved aside, and can now be battled like any other. Defeating Coach Trainer Harjit earns you
TM60
(
Megahorn
).

Cerulean Cave
is a mysterious cavern located in the northwest part of
Cerulean City
. Only the most powerful Trainers who have entered the
Hall of Fame
are allowed to enter due to the powerful wild Pokémon inside. The sprawling cave network is unforgiving, so be sure to prepare well. Pack the
Super Rod
and stock up on
Ultra Balls
, and bring the
Master Ball
as well. It is here that the
genetically-engineered Pokémon
from
Cinnabar Island
's
Pokémon Mansion
fled after escaping the facility.

Head to the water's edge and use
Sea Skim
to reach a
PP Max
on the island in the northeast corner. Ignore the nearby and ladder and continue surfing westward. At the west end of the water, you can reach dry land to the north and south. Climb the hill to the north to get a
Max Repel
, then head south along the ridge or the water to find a
Full Heal
. Turn eastward and continue along the central ridge in a counter-clockwise direction to pick up a
Max Revive
on the north side. With the first floor cleared, you may climb either nearby ladder to reach 2F.
2F
The second floor is one large, open chamber. Be sure to collect the several visible items that are scattered around, including treasures like a
Rare Candy
and a
Max Revive
. There are also several glowing spots on the ground that mark the potential location of other
hidden treasures
. To continue through the cave, climb down the ladder in the northwest corner.
1F (Northwest)
Take the next ladder down to the lower floor.
B1F
Go east along the ridge and walk down the hill. Continue along to the northeast corner, where an
Escape Rope
can be found. Head south along the east wall. From the southeast corner, turn north and climb onto the central ridge. Move north to reach a
Full Restore
, then go west. Head south and zigzag a bit to reach a
Max Elixir
near a patch of glowing crystals. Use
Sea Skim
to reach the southwest island and find
Mewtwo
, alone on its island. Like with the
legendary birds
, Mewtwo will reappear if defeated or run from after you enter the
Hall of Fame
again.
VS Mewtwo
Not only is
Mewtwo
the strongest Pokémon around, but it has already reached level 70. As a
Psychic-type
Pokémon, it is best to use
Bug
-,
Ghost
-, and
Dark-type
attacks to lower its health quickly. The Legendary Pokémon can restore its health repeatedly with
Recover
, so inflicting status ailments like
Sleep
and
Paralysis
are useful to limit its movements. Mewtwo will not let itself be caught easily, so either use the
Master Ball
immediately after it is defeated or be prepared to go through more than a few
Ultra Balls
. When the battle is over, use an
Escape Rope
to quickly exit the cave.

Still Hunting a Legend
When you exit the cave,
Trace
rushes up to you from the west. He's impressed that you have captured
Mewtwo
, but disappointed that you beat him to it. He tells you that he ran into "some gutsy girl" who was looking for a powerful Pokémon, and must have gone into the cave. With Mewtwo captured, Trace isn't interested in exploring the cave anymore, and gives you his three
Escape Ropes
instead. He thinks that the girl is likely still looking for Mewtwo, and suggests going back to show her.
Cerulean Cave
Make your way through the cave again to return to
Mewtwo
's island on the lower floor. On the north side, you find a girl standing with her back to you. Speak to her, and you are suddenly hit with a low-flying Poké Ball! She apologizes for mistaking you for a Pokémon, and introduces herself as
Green
. She asks if you are also here looking for "something special", and is upset to learn that you have already caught the Genetic Pokémon, and so challenges you to a battle!

After the battle,
Green
accepts that
Mewtwo
belongs with you, and hands you a pair of items as a reward: the
Mewtwonite X
and the
Mewtwonite Y
. With these
Mega Stones
, Mewtwo can now
Mega Evolve
into one of two forms during battle, boosting its aleady-high stats to incredible heights! The girl has an idea, and jokingly asks if you would like to become her Pokémon alongside Mewtwo. She even throws several Poké Balls at you! When she's had enough, she runs off, leaving you free to collect the five
Poké Balls
that she left behind.
