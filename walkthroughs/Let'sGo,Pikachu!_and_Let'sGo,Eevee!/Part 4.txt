Inside the Pokémon Center,
a shady man
to the left of the counter offers to sell you a
Magikarp
for
$
500. The fish is nearly useless until it evolves into the powerful
Gyarados
at level 20. With enough money to spare, you can end up with a strong
Water-type
Pokémon sooner than normal.

When you first enter the cave, you run into the
two shady characters
that had previously blocked the road through
Viridian City
. They let slip that they are looking for rare
Fossils
to sell, and demand that you hand them over if you find any.
Collect the
Potion
to the west, then battle Bug Catcher Kent to reach a set of 5
Great Balls
. Follow the tunnel eastward to battle Lass Evelyn and turn the corner.
The red-haired woman from earlier
is annoyed that she cannot get away from you, and runs off to the north. Climb down the nearest ladder to B2F.
B2F (South)
Grab the
Rare Candy
from the raised platform. Inspect the crater to find a hidden
Moon Stone
and take the ladder back to 1F.
1F
Go south to battle Super Nerd Jovan and pick up the nearby
Awakening
. Continue east past Youngster Robby to reach an
Ether
. Turn north through the eastern-most tunnel to pick up a
Repel
, then inspect the crater to the north for a
Stardust
. Battle Lass Miriam and continue westward.
The blue-haired man
tells you to stop following them and runs farther ahead. Climb down the second ladder to a different part of the basement.
B2F (Northeast)
Pick up the
Nugget
from the platform. Inspect the crater to find another hidden
Moon Stone
before returning to 1F.
1F
Continue westward along the tunnel. Grab the
Pearl
in the crater to the north, then climb the third ladder.
B1F
A short distance from the ladder, you catch up to the
Meowth
that belongs to the
two shady characters
, who runs off in a hurry.
B2F (Outer Area)
Go north to get a
Revive
, then head southeast to battle a
Team Rocket
Grunt and collect the nearby
Potion
.
In the southeast corner, you find the two shady characters trying to convince Meowth to help them gather Fossils.
Continue along the winding tunnel in a clockwise direction to the northwest, where you find another
Revive
and another Team Rocket Grunt blocking the way. Head north to be stopped by Super Nerd Miguel, who claims both the
Helix Fossil
and
Dome Fossil
lying here as his own. Defeat him, and he lets you choose one of them for yourself. The Helix Fossil was once a
Omanyte
, while the Dome Fossil was once an
Kabuto
. Go west toward the final ladder and you are ambushed by
the shady duo and their Meowth
, who finally introduce themselves as
Jessie
and
James
. They intend to steal the fossil you just acquired, and draw you into battle. As the first
Double Battle
you have encountered, the Pokémon in the top-left and top-center slots in your party will take part.
