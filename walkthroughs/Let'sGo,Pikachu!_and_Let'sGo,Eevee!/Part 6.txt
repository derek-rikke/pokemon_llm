A Rare Addition
Speak to
Officer Jenny
near the city's north entrance. She recently apprehended a mischievous
Squirtle
that was causing trouble around the city, and now needs to find a Trainer who can tame its unruly behavior. If you have caught at least 60 Pokémon, she recognizes you as a competent Trainer and asks that you give Squirtle a good home.
Time for a Trade
Visit the Pokémon Center and speak to the Hiker sitting on the sofa. He is hoping to trade for a
Geodude
, and is willing to part with his
Alolan
Geodude
in exchange. His is a
Rock
/
Electric
Pokémon, a unique typing not seen outside of its evolutionary family. This trade may be conducted multiple times.
This or That
To the west of the Poké Mart, there is a person sitting on a bench who asks if you prefer the Puppy Pokémon,
Growlithe
, or the Scratch Cat Pokémon,
Meowth
. Regardless of your answer, you are given a certain task.
This Black Belt asks that you catch 5 Growlithe. Speak to him again after doing so to receive a
Persian
P
.
This Beauty asks that you catch 5 Meowth. Speak to her again after doing so to receive an
Arcanine
E
.
Instead of this Pokémon following behind when let outside of its Poké Ball, you are able to ride on its back! This lets you move at a faster pace than the normal walking or running speed.
Pokémon Fan Club
The building to the north of the
Vermilion Gym
is home to the
Pokémon Fan Club
. Speak to the Chairman and listen to his rambling thoughts to receive either a
Pikachu Set
P
or an
Eevee Set
E
in appreciation. This lets you dress up like your
partner Pokémon
!
After becoming best friends with your partner Pokémon, speak to the Chairman again to receive more clothing for both you and your Pokémon. This time, he gives you the
Raichu Set
P
or the 8
Eeveelution Sets
E
.
Dressing the Part
As you head south to Vermilion Port, show the
S.S. Ticket
to the Sailor here and you are free to board the
S.S. Anne
. In addition, he gives you a
Sailor Set
for being the 100th guest on the ship. This includes a set for both you and your partner Pokémon.

When you enter the ship, you are greeted by
Trace
. As he thanks you again for his ticket,
Blue
approaches from the left. He is headed to the exit with his party favors, and shares one with you: a
Shalour Sable
. He mentions having overheard rumors about
Team Rocket
's plans, and warns the two of you to avoid the group before leaving the ship. If you take the time to talk to Trace, he'll reveal that not only is Blue strong enough to have beaten the
Pokémon League
's
Elite Four
in the past, but also that he apparently had a
rival
who's even stronger than him.
From the entrance, you can speak to the girl in the first room on the right to have her heal your Pokémon. Turn to the right and take the stairs down to the lower floor.
B1F
This part of the ship is a dead-end hallway with five cabins. Visit the middle room for a
Full Heal
, then battle Engineer Dylan to reach an
Elixir
. Battle Sailor Huey and pick up the
Super Potion
in the fourth room from the stairs, then head back up to the main floor.
1F
Follow the hallway around to the front of the ship, and visit the second cabin from the left to get a
Paralyze Heal
. Turn the corner and continue on to reach the kitchen. Collect the
Super Repel
, then leave the kitchen and climb the nearest stairs to reach the upper floor.
2F
The nearest doorway leads to the deck of the ship, where two Sailors are looking to battle. Step inside the second cabin from the left to get a
Revive
, then visit the fourth room to battle the two Gentlemen and pick up a
Nugget
. When you approach the captain's quarters at the back of the ship,
Trace
is just leaving. He mentions that the man is famous for mastering a
Secret Technique
and offers to teach the move to anyone interested.
Rival Battle 4
Trace
's team is much the same as it was in the previous battle in
Cerulean City
, aside from his
Pidgey
having evolved and a couple of new moves.

After the battle, he urges you to visit the captain to learn his
Secret Technique
. Enter the captain's quarters to find him hunched over a trash can; it seems like he got seasick. Speak to him to help him out with a quick backrub and he will be feeling good as new. He is about to teach you his Secret Technique as thanks until your
partner Pokémon
makes it clear that it wants to learn the move, too. The famous swordmaster walks over to a potted plant in the corner and chops it down in one swing!
Chop Down
lets you cut down certain inconveniently-placed trees to reach new areas.
Be sure to collect all of the items on board before leaving, as the ship sets sail when you do.
Meet Mina
After the ship leaves, you find a blonde girl standing on the pier. She was so caught up with sketching a picture of the ocean that she missed her ship, which she intended to ride on her way home to the tropical
Alola
region. She does not seem very bothered by this change in her plans and decides to stay here in
Kanto
for a while longer.
Mina
specializes in
Fairy-type
Pokémon and can be challenged to battle once per day.

Vermilion City
Visit the Pokémon Center to prepare for the upcoming Gym, then make your way to the southwest part of town. When you approach the small tree growing next to the building, the
Gym guide
calls out to you from the other side. Examine the tree to use
Chop Down
and clear the path to the Gym.
Vermilion Gym
Vermilion City Pokémon Gym
Leader: Lt. Surge
The Lightning Lieutenant
The
Vermilion Gym
specializes in
Electric-type
Pokémon. Electric-type moves are super effective against
Flying
- and
Water-type
Pokémon, while Electric-type Pokémon are weak to
Ground-type
moves.
Grass
Pokémon are a good option, as well; they resist Electric attacks and can fight back with status moves like
Sleep Powder
. The Gym Leader can be found in the back room, beyond an electronic barrier. Reaching him requires challengers to
flip two switches
hidden among the many trash cans. When defeated, the Gym Trainers hint that a can next to the blue can contains a switch, while none of the cans next to the red can contain one. Once the first switch has been found, the second will be in an adjacent can. If the wrong can is inspected and there is no switch inside, the puzzle resets.
Each of
Lt. Surge
's Pokémon know
Thunderbolt
, a powerful
Electric-type
attack that receives a
Same-type attack bonus
when used by each of his Electric Pokémon. The best way to avoid this is to use only
Ground-type
Pokémon like
Diglett
, as they are immune to Electric moves. His
Magnemite
also takes serious damage from
Fire
- and
Fighting-type
moves. Be especially careful with his
Raichu
, as it has the higher stats of an evolved Pokémon, so its Thunderbolt hits harder. Certain Ground Pokémon like
Geodude
and
Onix
are part-
Rock
, as well; though immune to Electric moves, Raichu's
Double Kick
deals serious damage to Rock Pokémon.

After the battle,
Lt. Surge
awards you the
Thunder Badge
. Having three Badges ensures obedience from all Pokémon up to level 40. He also gives you his
Autograph
and
TM36
(
Thunderbolt
) as prizes.
Meet Up with Misty
After leaving the Gym and chopping down the small tree,
Misty
calls out to you from next to the Poké Mart. She is impressed that you have defeated
Lt. Surge
and heals your Pokémon to full health. She is on her way to swim in the sea and wonders where you are headed next. After suggesting
Diglett's Cave
, she offers to show you the way. If you accept her offer, she walks with you to the entrance of Diglett's Cave on
Route 11
, to the east of the city.
