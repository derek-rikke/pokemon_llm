Treasure Trouble
On the first visit to the beach outside

, the
Team Rocket trio
can be found trying to come up with their next get-rich-quick scheme. It seems that they had visited
GO Park
looking for rare Pokémon, but the place was too complicated and they took off.
Jessie
accidentally kicks something hard in the sand, and
James
excitedly wonders if it could be some kind of treasure. They dig up the item, which shines gold in the sun, but it turns out to only be someone's
Gold Teeth
. They're too grossed out to take it, so Jessie tosses it at you as they run off.

1F
Head northeast and use
Strong Push
to move the boulder to the hole in the floor so that it falls to the floor below. Climb up onto the rocky ridge and pick up the
Ice Heal
to the west. Go north and defeat Coach Trainer Yas to get five
Rare Candies
. Continue east past the first ladder and grab the
Escape Rope
. If you are running low on Poké Balls, speak to the man on the east side of the rocky ridge to get some more. Push the second boulder down the hole in the northeast area, then backtrack and climb down the first ladder.
B1F (West)
Go northeast over the rocky ridge to get a
Super Repel
, and climb down the ladder on the eastern ridge.
B2F (South)
Head south from the ridge to find
TM55
(
Ice Beam
) tucked away in a corner. Climb back up the same ladder to return to B1F.
B1F (West)
Continue northeastward and push the boulder down through the next break in the floor. Backtrack to the west and grab the
Max Potion
in the northwest corner before climbing the northwest ladder.
B2F (Northwest)
Walk eastward to find the same boulder and drop it down to the next floor. Once it falls through, return to the first floor and climb down the ladder in the northeast area.
B1F (Northeast)
Pick up the set of five
Great Balls
. Drop the boulder through the hole and jump down after it.
B2F (Northeast)
Push the boulder through the next hole and continue after it.
B3F
Moving these two boulders has caused them to fall into the seawater flowing through here, blocking the swift ocean currents and allowing you to use
Sea Skim
to reach new places. Climb onto the rocky ridge to the west and loop around in a clockwise direction to reach a
Super Lure
near the northwest ladder. Go south to reach an
X Speed
, then grab the
Hyper Potion
to the east. Head southwest to reach a group of boulders. In the alcove, push the boulder on the right to the north wall. Move the boulder on the left two steps southward, then one step westward. Next, push the boulder sitting to the south of the ladder all the way to the west. Move the boulder on the right so it is one step north of the eastern gap in the floor, and drop it down. Push the boulder on the left to the western hole and jump down behind it.
B4F
With the second set of boulders blocking the currents, you may now reach the small northwest island. Grab the
Big Pearl
from the water's edge and be sure to save your progress before approaching the legendary bird Pokémon.
VS Articuno
Articuno
is likely the first of the
Legendary birds
that you will encounter. Use
Fire
-,
Electric
-, and
Rock-type
attacks to defeat it quickly and attempt to catch it. Legendary Pokémon will not let themselves be captured easily, so use
Ultra Balls
and
Razz Berry
variants for best results!

Big Pearl
on the water's edge, then backtrack and climb up the western ladder.
B3F
Walk up onto the rocky ridge and go east. Surf to the eastern shore, pick up the set of three
Ultra Balls
, and climb the ladder in the southeast. This takes you through a series of ladders back up to ground level; be sure to collect the
Ice Stone
and
Super Lure
along the way. Take the exit in the southeast part of 1F to re-emerge on
Route 20
through the eastern island.
