All Trainers traveling to
Indigo Plateau
must present their Badges to prove their worth. The first guard looks to see if a Trainer has earned the
Boulder Badge
. The other guards are posted at various checkpoints farther along the route to inspect each Trainer for the other seven Badges. Once the last guard has verified that you have earned the
Earth Badge
, you are free to enter Victory Road.
Victory Road

There are several large boulders in
Victory Road
that can only be moved with
Strong Push
, like in the
Seafoam Islands
. However, instead of dropping them down through holes in the floor, they must be moved onto pressure switches to unlock new areas.

Go east from the entrance and use
Strong Push
to move the boulder eastward (→1) onto the nearby pressure switch; this lowers the stone wall on the central ridge. Head to the northeast area to battle Coach Trainer Alemana; defeat him to receive ten Candies for your
Partner Pokémon
. Head north to find two items near the north wall. The cave's narrow layout forces you to use the boulder here to block off one item in order to reach the other. Collect either the
Leaf Stone
or
TM56
(
Stealth Rock
), then exit and re-enter the cave to reset the puzzle and reach the other item. Go west to battle Ace Trainer Naomi on the central ridge, then continue west to fight Ace Trainer Rolando. Grab the set of three
Ultra Balls
sitting nearby and climb up the ladder to the northwest.
2F
Another boulder can be found to the south. Push this one southwestward (←1, ↓1, ←2) to reach the switch and lower the next stone wall. Walk up onto the rocky ridge and battle Juggler Nelson. Head east to fight Black Belt Daisuke, then go down either of the two ramps. Pick up
TM45
(
Solar Beam
) to the west, then loop around the ridge to find a
Full Restore
near Tamer Vincent. Continue to the northeast to fight Juggler Gregory and pick up
TM49
(
Superpower
). Climb the northeast ladder to the third floor.
3F
Go northeast to fight Ace Trainer George and pick up a
Max Revive
. Head westward to find
Officer Jenny
standing near another boulder. She is in the middle of her patrol, but takes a moment to heal your Pokémon to full health. Go south to pick up
TM51
(
Blizzard
). Another switch can be found in the northwest area; start near Officer Jenny and move the boulder southwestward (↑1, ←2, ↓1, ←4, ↓3, →1). This lowers the next stone wall on the central ridge. Climb down the northwest ladder to reach a separate part of the second floor.
2F
Go east to find a
PP Max
, then walk up the slope to the north.
Moltres
, the third of the

is the third of the

. Use

Max Potion
to the west. Go south to battle Ace Trainer Colby and/or Ace Trainer Caroline. Pick up the set of five
Golden Nanab Berries
to the northeast. Head east and push the boulder here down through the hole in the floor, then jump down after it.
2F
Shove the boulder all the way westward to the switch. This lowers the stone wall near where the boulder landed. Climb up onto the ridge and battle Poké Maniac Dawson, then take the ladder up to the third floor.
3F (Southeast)
Grab the
Full Restore
to the south. Go north and fight Coach Trainer Ryan, who gives out
TM39
(
Outrage
) when defeated. Climb down the north ladder back to the second floor.
2F (East)
Take the eastern exit to return to
Route 23
.
Route 23 (North)
Follow the path to the stone walkway and pass through the series of Poké Ball statues. The
Pokémon League
building sits atop one final stone staircase. Both you and your
partner Pokémon
are awestruck and more determined than ever. This is it!
