Route 1
Route 1
Route 1
is a peaceful, country road that leads north from
Pallet Town
to
Viridian City
. The path is riddled with patches of
tall grass
and one-way
ledges
that make northward travel difficult.

Into the Wilderness
Several kinds of wild Pokémon can be seen wandering through the area. To catch a Pokémon, Trainers may only use Berries to make a Pokémon easier to capture; it is not possible to battle wild Pokémon with your own to weaken them. Catching a Pokémon is the only way to earn valuable
Experience Points
for your Pokémon team. Since you already have 50 Poké Balls, it is a good time to catch plenty of these Pokémon to start raising your new partner.
The Nose Knows
As you approach the north end of the route, your Pikachu
P
/ Eevee
E
will notice a bush to the east. Whenever it acts like this, be sure to take a closer look at whatever caught its attention. In this case, speaking to the young Pokémon will reveal that it has caught the scent of a
Razz Berry
, which makes a wild Pokémon easier to catch. These items sometimes respawn as well, and may be different each time.
Viridian City
Viridian City
Viridian City
is a small, nature-loving city that is enveloped in green year-round. It is located between
Route 1
to the south,
Route 2
to the north, and
Route 22
to the west.

Pokémon Center
The nearest building with the red roof is the
Pokémon Center
. This Pokémon hospital will heal your team to full health and eliminate any status ailments they may have. It is a good idea to heal up and save your progress whenever you find a Pokémon Center.
Trainers' School
The
Trainers' School
in the city's center teaches inexperienced Trainers about the basics of battle. A blackboard in the front of the room describes the five
status ailments
that can affect a Pokémon.
Ailment
Effect(s)
Burned
Burn
Damage dealt by
physical moves
is halved; inflicts damage equal to 1/16 of maximum
HP

Paralysis

Asleep
Sleep
Cannot move for one to three turns.
Trouble Ahead
On your first visit to
Viridian City
, there is a
woman with red hair and a man with blue hair
blocking the way northward. They mention something about guard duty and refuse to move. There is nothing to be done about this yet, so continue exploring the rest of the city instead.
Poké Mart
Another shop with a blue roof sits to the northeast of the Pokémon Center. This is the local
Poké Mart
; these stores offer a variety of Poké Balls, Potions, and other items. It is a good idea to stock up on supplies whenever possible, as there is no telling what you may run into on your journey. More items become available for purchase based on the number of
Badges
a Trainer has earned.
Special Delivery
When you approach the Poké Mart, the clerk is standing outside the door. He recognizes you as someone from
Pallet Town
and explains that he has a delivery for
Professor Oak
. He hands Oak's
Parcel
to you and asks that you take it to him. Once he walks back inside the shop, the player is presented with the option to warp directly back to the lab.
Pallet Town
Oak's Lab
The professor asks how Pikachu
P
/ Eevee
E
is doing, and in response the young Pokémon happily climbs up onto your shoulder
P
/ hat
E
. Oak accepts his
Parcel
from you and
Trace
arrives a moment later. The professor shares the parcel's contents, and you each receive 20
Razz Berries
. He explains that wild Pokémon are so happy to get a treat like this, that using one before throwing a Poké Ball makes them distracted and much easier to catch.
Rival Battle 1
When you go to leave, Trace challenges you to your first Trainer battle! When battling another Trainer, you will use your own Pokémon to fight. The first Pokémon that you send out will be the one in the top-left position in your party. Select
Fight
, then choose an attack for your Pokémon to use. This battle should be easy if you have caught a few other Pokémon for backup.

Dress the Part
On your second trip out of
Pallet Town
, you find
Trace
's big sister near the entrance to
Route 1
. Speak to her to receive a set of
Sportswear
to dress up your partner Pokémon. Pikachu
P
/ Eevee
E
happily hops down onto your arm and allows you to interact with it, unlocking the
Partner Play
function. This lets you pet the Pokémon and feed it Berries to increase its
friendship
. In addition, the
Play with Pikachu
P
/ Eevee
E
option, which allows you to access Partner Play, is now unlocked on the main menu.

Partway through the route, you run across the clerk from the
Viridian City
Poké Mart. Speak to him and he thanks you for delivering the
Parcel
. He invites you to visit the Poké Mart as they offer a wide variety of merchandise, and gives you a
Potion
as a free sample.
Challenge Accepted
Before you can return to Viridian City, the Youngster near the north end of the route challenges you to a battle. It should be an easy fight, as he only has a single Pokémon. Winning battles against other Trainers not only earns you prize money, but sometimes various types of
Poké Ball
as well. While catching Pokémon is the best way to earn
Experience Points
, battling other Trainers is the best method of earning these other resources.
Viridian City
Rest & Recharge
On your second visit to
Viridian City
, you find
Trace
standing near the Pokémon Center. Noticing that you just defeated another Trainer and your Pokémon may be injured, he suggests resting your team at the Pokémon Center, and then runs off.
Supplies for Sale
With Oak's
Parcel
delivered, it is now possible to purchase items at the Poké Mart. It is always best to stock up on Poké Balls and Potions whenever possible. The nearby forest is home to many poisonous
Bug-type
Pokémon, so it would be good to bring an
Antidote
or two as well.

Walk the Walk
North of the Trainers' School is another house with a woman and her
Oddish
standing outside. She compliments your partner Pokémon but thinks that hers would be too heavy to carry, so she has it walk alongside her instead. She demonstrates by letting the second Pokémon in your party out of its Poké Ball to follow you around. This can be done for any Pokémon in your party by selecting the
Take out of Poké Ball
option.
Nicknaming a Pokémon
There is a man inside the house near the woman and her Oddish who mentions
nicknaming
a Pokémon. This can be done by selecting a Pokémon in the party and choosing the
Change name
option. It is not possible to nickname Pokémon as they are caught, and must be done manually for each Pokémon.
Detour
At this point, you may proceed north to Route 2, or make an optional detour westward to
Route 22
first.
Route 22
It is not yet possible to fully explore
Route 22
, but you may still hunt for new Pokémon. A short way into the route,
Trace
appears and challenges you to a battle.

Little has changed since your fight in Oak's Lab, but his
partner Pokémon
has learned a new move. Trace has added a

to his team, as well. Use the same tactics from your last battle to wear his Pokémon down and take the win.

Overgrown trees
block access to the east side for now. Head through the
gate
to enter the forest, a whole new area with new Pokémon to catch!
