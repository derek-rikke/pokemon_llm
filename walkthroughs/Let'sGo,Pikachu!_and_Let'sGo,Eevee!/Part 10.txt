The northwestern-most house belongs to a girl known as the

. Show her a

TM08
(

Pokémon Center
Time for a Trade
Speak to the Ace Trainer standing to the left of the counter. She would like to trade for a
Raichu
, and is willing to part with its
Alolan
counterpart in exchange. Hers is an
Electric
/
Psychic
Pokémon, a unique typing not seen outside of its evolutionary family. This trade may be conducted multiple times.
Mr. Psychic's house
The southeast house belongs to a man known as Mr. Psychic. Speak to him and he claims to know exactly why you are here, and gives you
TM40
(
Psychic
).
Friendly Fire
The Rocket Grunt posted outside the
Silph Co.
building is under orders to allow entry only to authorized members, and refuses to let
Jessie and James
inside. Jessie fights with the guard and pushes past him, leaving him dazed before James follows a moment later. This leaves a perfect opportunity to enter the skyscraper undetected.
Silph Co.
The
Silph Company
is the leading manufacturer of items like Poké Balls, Potions, and TMs. Their products are supplied to every Poké Mart in the region. The company has been a target of
Team Rocket
, first for their
Silph Scope
prototype, and now for a top-secret development project. The building holds eleven floors, with
warp tiles
allowing the workers to quickly move around. This convenience ends up acting as a maze for anyone trying to reach the top floor.

Upon entering the lobby, the receptionist calls out to you, warning you to stay away as it is no place for children with all the dangerous people around.
Blue
and
Trace
arrive a moment later. Blue goes over their plan: it's up to you to drive
Team Rocket
out of
Silph Co.
, with Trace accompanying you as backup. In the meantime, Blue intends to travel across
Kanto
, defeating any remaining Team Rocket members he can find. Between the three of you, someone is sure to find out where the group's boss is hiding. Before the trio can split up, Blue needs to be sure that you two are up to the task, and challenges you to battle.

Afterward, Archer realizes that it was not simply luck that let you defeat him the last time, and promises to be more careful about you and Trace before he and the Rocket Grunt run off. Trace notices that the Rocket Grunt dropped something as they escaped, and you take the
Card Key
from him. This key card is used to open the building's electronic doors. Unlock the northwest room to battle Scientist Beau and grab a
Max Ether
. Go south to battle another Rocket Grunt and follow the hallway along the east wall to reach a
Nugget
. Backtrack to the large meeting room and unlock the smaller room to get a

. Pass through the meeting room to get an

. Collect the
PP Up
in the eastern hallway and climb the stairs to 7F.

Unlock the east-central room to battle the third of the Rocket Sisters and pick up
TM34
(

Smart Candies
. Turn around and follow the central hallway to the southwest room; battle Scientist Joshua here to reach the
PP Up
. Backtrack and unlock the central room to find a couple of office workers and a
Rare Candy
. Speak to the man sitting on the red chair in the northeast corner to receive a
Lapras
. They had been keeping it in their lab, but he thinks it would be much better off with you. Take the stairs up to 9F.
9F
Swipe the Card Key to unlock the east-central room, and again to reach the southeast room. Collect the set of three
Great Balls
from the shelves to the west and the set of three
Poké Balls
on the floor to the south. Battle Scientist Ed to reach the set of three
Ultra Balls
on the shelves to the east.
Defeat the fourth and final Rocket Sister at the south end of the central hallway, then open the door to the break room. Speak to self-proclaimed spy disguised as
Nurse Joy
, and she heals your Pokémon to full health as thanks for your efforts. Pick up the

to the south and climb the stairs to the tenth floor.
10F
Battle Scientist Travis, then pick up the
Full Heal
to the west. Defeat the Rocket Grunt, then pick up

When you reach the northwest room on the seventh floor,
Trace
is waiting for you. The reunion is short-lived, as
Archer
appears after following you through the same teleporter. He is here to stop the two of you from reaching his boss. Realizing that
Giovanni
is indeed up ahead, Trace draws Archer into battle to buy time for you to confront the Rocket boss. Take the final warp tile to the west side of 11F.
11F (West)
As you proceed along the hallway, you are stopped by
Jessie and James
again. They claim that their boss is in a meeting and intend to defeat you so that he will not be disturbed.

Afterward, the trio flees northward. Use the Card Key to open the door and confront
Giovanni
. He is here to take the company's
Master Ball
prototype, but the president refuses to cooperate. This only angers Giovanni, who resorts to blackmailing the president by wondering aloud what may happen to the company's workers if he does not comply. The two men then notice you, and Giovanni claims to be discussing a vital business proposition. He warns you to stay out of grown-up matters before drawing you into battle.

With
Giovanni
defeated,
Team Rocket
's plans for
Silph Co.
have been thwarted. He vows that the group will never fall and promises to return. Giovanni and his underlings make their escape, while their co-conspirators also flee the building. Speak to the president, who is so grateful to you for saving Silph that he rewards you with the
Master Ball
prototype. This improved kind of Poké Ball has a 100% success rate, so be sure to save it for a hard-to-catch Pokémon.
Fighting Dojo
Fighting Dojo
Saffron City
is unique as the only city to have two Pokémon Gyms. The
Fighting Dojo
is located in the northeast neighborhood, next door to the
Saffron Gym
. The two clubs had once competed to determine which would become the city's one official Gym, and the
Psychic
Pokémon of Saffron Gym were victorious. There is no Badge to be won here, but defeat the
Karate Master
to earn the choice of two rare
Fighting-type
Pokémon: the hard-kicking
Hitmonlee
or the piston-punching
Hitmonchan
. Use Psychic- and
Flying-type
attacks here for greatest effect.

Pokémon, while Psychic-type Pokémon are weak to

moves. All challengers are required to present a Pokémon of at least level 45 to enter. The Gym is designed as a glitzy skyline, with
a series of warp tiles
linking the rooftop-like platforms to confuse and disorient any challengers.
Step on the tile near the entrance to reach the southeast room. To reach the Gym Leader by using as few warps as possible, continue by stepping on either of these two warp tiles to reach the south-southwest room and battle Psychic Johan. Take the northeast warp to the middle room, then the southeast warp to the east-southeast room and battle Ace Trainer Amanda. Step on the southeast tile to reach the northwest platform. The two other warp tiles on this platform lead to diverging paths to the Gym Leader.
The northeast warp leads to the platform with Channeler Imari, to the southwest of the Gym Leader. Take the northwest warp to reach the northeast platform.
The southeast warp leads to the platform with Ace Trainer Cameron, to the southeast of the Gym Leader. Take the northeast warp to reach the northeast platform.
From the northeast platform with Psychic Preston, take the northwest warp tile to reach the northern-most platform, where
Sabrina
awaits anyone up to the challenge.
