Go westward to battle Lass Joana and pick up the 5

in the tall grass farther west. Follow the trail to the north then west to fight Bug Catcher Brian and find a
Tiny Mushroom
in the tall grass. Go east to reach an
Antidote
near the Trainer Tips sign. Return to the entrance, and this time head eastward. Battle Bug Catcher Rick on the east side of the forest and collect the 3
Razz Berries
in the tall grass, then continue north to reach a fork in the road. Tall grass covers the western path, while Lass Brittany can be fought on the eastern one. These paths combine a short distance to the north before splitting again. Take the eastern path to grab the nearby
Potion
sitting behind a tree, then turn west toward the tall grass. Zigzag westward through the trees to reach a signpost. Explore the dead-end path to the southeast to get a
Lure
, then continue westward. Defeat one last Bug Catcher to reach the northern edge of the forest. Leave the gate to re-emerge on
Route 2
and continue north to
Pewter City
.
Trainer Tips
Attracting Wild Pokémon with Lures
A
Lure
is used to increase the encounter rate of less common Pokémon, including
Shiny Pokémon
, for a certain number of steps. It also causes any wild Pokémon spawned to be one level greater than the upper limit for the area. This is the only way to find several rare species, like
Bulbasaur
.
Pewter City
Pewter City
Pewter City
is a quiet city nestled in the northern mountains between
Route 2
and
Route 3
. The
Pewter Museum of Science
and the
Pewter Gym
are located here.

Meet Up with Trace
When you enter
Pewter City
, you find
Trace
waiting for you. He tells you about the local
Pokémon Gym
and the
Gym Leader
who runs it, then gives you 5
Potions
to help take on the challenge.
Calling All Challengers
The local
Gym Leader
is looking for challengers, and the boy standing near the city's east exit will escort you to the Gym if you try to leave.
Pewter Museum of Science
The
Pewter Museum of Science
is located on the north side of the city. It hosts a wide range of artifacts and exhibits, with a focus on
fossil
excavation and space exploration. Admission to the main building is
$
50 for a child's ticket. The smaller building next door is closed to the public.
Slowpoke Sitting
A woman and her
Slowpoke
can be found on the northwest hill. She would like to visit the museum, but Slowpoke doesn't feel much like moving. She asks if you would babysit the Pokémon for her; agree, and you will have a relaxing time watching Slowpoke while she is away. She returns a short time later, and gives you a
Big Pearl
as thanks. This valuable item can be sold for an impressive
$
4,000!
Pewter Gym
Pewter City Pokémon Gym
Leader: Brock
The Rock-Solid Pokémon Trainer
The
Pewter Gym
specializes in
Rock-type
Pokémon. Rock-type moves are super effective against
Bug
-,
Fire
-,
Flying
-, and
Ice-type
Pokémon, while Rock-type Pokémon are weak to
Fighting
-,
Grass
-,
Ground
-,
Water
-, and
Steel-type
moves. All of the Pokémon in the Pewter Gym are partly Ground type, as well, leaving them immune to
Electric
attacks.
When you enter the Gym, you are stopped by the
Gym guide
. He explains that the Pewter Gym only allows Trainers who know about type matchups to enter. The rule is that Trainers who have never challenged a Gym before must bring along a Grass or Water Pokémon to have an advantage. Water Pokémon haven't been available yet, so be sure to show him an
Oddish
,
Bellsprout
, or
Bulbasaur
.
Pikachu
and
Eevee
both learn
Double Kick
, a Fighting attack, around level 10. Alongside a Grass Pokémon, they should be able to make short work of the Pewter Gym.

After the battle,
Brock
awards you the
Boulder Badge
. Having one Badge ensures obedience from all Pokémon up to level 20. He also gives you
TM01
(
Headbutt
) as a prize.
Meet Blue
When you leave the Gym, you are approached by a young man who introduces himself as
Professor Oak
's grandson,
Blue
. He heard from the professor that two new Trainers had set out from
Pallet Town
, like he once did, and came here to offer advice on challenging the first Gym. Since he is too late, he gives you a reward of 5
Great Balls
instead.
Heading Out on a Hike
With the
Pewter Gym
defeated, your next destination is
Cerulean City
to the east. Before setting off, be sure to visit the Poké Mart to view its updated inventory.
Great Balls
are now available for purchase, as are
Escape Ropes
and
Repels
, all of which will be helpful in the cave up ahead. Once you are ready, head east to reach
Route 3
.
