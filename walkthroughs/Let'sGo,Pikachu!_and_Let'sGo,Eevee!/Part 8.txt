Rock Tunnel
Rock Tunnel
As it has been left in its natural state and undeveloped,
Rock Tunnel
is pitch-black inside. Though not required, travel is made much easier when
Light Up
is used to illuminate the winding tunnels. There are many Trainers within the cave, whether for the fun of exploring, training, or simply having gotten lost in the darkness.

Cubone's Lament
When you first enter
Lavender Town
, a
Cubone
can be seen running into
Pokémon Tower
in the northeast part of town, with
Trace
following close behind.
Pokémon Tower
As the place where departed Pokémon are laid to rest,
Pokémon Tower
has a strong connection to the spirit world and most of the wild Pokémon inside belong to the
Ghost
type. The paranormal activity increases beyond the second floor, where ghosts and possessed Channelers are a common sight. However, without a
certain item
, it is impossible to reach the tower's highest floor and unidentified Pokémon cannot be caught.

Most
ghosts
inside the tower are truly mischievous Pokémon in disguise that can be battled and captured after being revealed.
Gastly
and
Haunter
are two of only three known
Ghost-type
Pokémon, so it is worthwhile to track them down. The one true ghost here blocks access to the top floor, but nothing can be done about it without a
certain item
. Rumor says there is some kind of prototype in
Celadon City
to the west that can reveal what is hidden.
1F
The first floor houses a visitor's center, where people come to pay their respects to their dearly departed Pokémon. Speak to the elderly woman to receive a
Formal Set
of clothing for you and your
partner Pokémon
.

Rival Battle 5
Trace
is surprised to see you here and wonders if you have lost any of your Pokémon. He offers to check and see if everyone is safe and sound, and challenges you to another battle to do so. By this point, his
Oddish
and partner Pokémon have both evolved. Use
Electric
- and
Rock-type
moves against Pidgeotto, and
Fire
and
Flying
moves against
Gloom
. Both Pokémon are also vulnerable to
Ice
attacks. Attack his
Jolteon
P
/
Raichu
E
with
Ground-type
moves for best results.

Afterward, Trace realizes that the battle has scared
Cubone
off. He says that it seemed like the Pokémon was searching for something, and wonders if it went to one of the higher floors. Go west to reach an
X Attack
and battle Coach Trainer Holly, who hands out 5 Candies for your partner Pokémon when defeated.
3F
Upon reaching 3F, Trace appears right behind you. He tries calling out for
Cubone
but it's no use. Suddenly, a large ghost approaches from the north and scares him back downstairs. The spirit drifts closer and tries to scare you off as well. Cubone appears and runs toward it, mistaking it for someone else. The spirit drifts away, and Cubone sadly trudges back down the stairs.
It is possible to explore most of the tower now, but beware: anyone who gets caught by these unidentified ghosts will be transported back to the first floor.
Lavender Volunteer Pokémon House
The Lavender Volunteer Pokémon House is located in the center of town. Founded by
Mr. Fuji
, the organization was established to care for orphaned and abandoned Pokémon. Many members of the group live here in their safe house while looking after these Pokémon. According to one man, it is odd that Mr. Fuji is not here at the moment, and wonders aloud where he may have gone.
Kidnapped!
When you approach the west side of town, you find
Jessie and James
looking for
Mr. Fuji
. They were unable reach the top of the tower because of some strange ghost in the way.
Cubone
walks up to Meowth a moment later and James suggests taking the Pokémon with them so that they have something to show for their trouble. Jessie helps lure the Pokémon away with them by promising to help find its mother, and the group runs off toward
Celadon City
.
