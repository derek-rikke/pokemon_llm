The

is an industrial complex that was abandoned years ago, though some of the machinery still works. Many forgotten items can be found lying around, but beware: some are actually

In Search of Power
Pass through the entrance room to get a
Max Revive
. Continue northward to find Coach Trainer Mable; defeat her to get five
Rare Candies
. Turn east and visit the narrow, west-east room in the middle of the building to find a
Voltorb Candy
. Leave this room and continue south to get an
X Sp. Def
. Travel south to the exterior wall and pick up another
Rare Candy
in the south-central room. Collect
TM38
(
Thunder
) in the southeast room, then follow the narrow hallway northward. Grab the
Thunder Stone
and
Max Potion
from the northeast room. Continue westward and pass through the first room at the end of the hallway to reach the second, which a
Paralyze Heal
can be found. Head northwest from here to reach the final room.
VS Zapdos
Zapdos
is likely the second of the
Legendary birds
that you will encounter. Use
Rock
- and
Ice-type
attacks to defeat it quickly and attempt to catch it. Like with
Articuno
,
Ultra Balls
and
Razz Berry
variants work best!

When the battle is over, step on the
warp tile
to the southwest to teleport outside the entrance, then fly back to
Viridian City
.
Viridian City
When you return to
Viridian City
, you find
Trace
standing outside the Gym. It seems the building is still closed, and Trace is unsure what to do. Each of you has collected seven
Badges
by now, leaving only the one from
Viridian Gym
. Trace suggests informing someone they cannot get into the Gym, so the two Trainers automatically travel back to
Pallet Town
.
Pallet Town
Oak's Lab
A New Form of Evolution?!
When you and
Trace
arrive,
Professor Oak
is speaking with his grandson,
Blue
. Blue congratulates the two of you for chasing
Team Rocket
out of the
Silph Co.
building, and has a reward for each of you. The
Key Stone
that he gives you enables certain Pokémon to achieve a greater form of evolution, called
Mega Evolution
. This can only be triggered during battle, but only if a Trainer holds the Pokémon's corresponding
Mega Stone
. The energy involved is too great for a Pokémon to sustain for long and the change wears off when battle ends. Fortunately, Blue also has several Mega Stones to give you: the
Venusaurite
, the
Charizardite X
, the
Charizardite Y
, and the
Blastoisinite
. He suggests trying these out when you challenge the
Pokémon League
.
A Shadow Reappears
When you leave the lab, your
partner Pokémon
notices something and runs off to the west. It is interested in what the girl in the flower patch is doing, but she is only picking flowers to make a bouquet for someone. She asks that you keep it a secret, and shares a bit of gossip: it seems that the mysterious
Viridian Gym
Leader has finally returned, so hurry back to
Viridian City
to claim that final
Badge
!
Viridian Gym
Viridian City Pokémon Gym
...
The Gym Leader of
Viridian Gym
has finally returned! Even the
Gym guide
does not know the person's identity. Earning the seven other
Badges
was enough of a challenge, so there is no formal requirement to enter the Gym. The Viridian Gym specializes in
Ground-type
Pokémon. Ground-type moves are super effective against
Fire
-,
Electric
-,
Rock
-,
Poison
-, and
Steel-type
Pokémon, while Ground-type Pokémon are weak to
Grass
-,
Water
-, and
Ice-type
moves.
The Viridian Gym uses a series of
spinner tiles
to disorient any challengers. Follow the green spinner tiles to the northeast, where you stop yourself by spinning into a fence. Battle Ace Trainer Samuel a short distance to the southwest. Take the green spinner tiles westward from here to reach a yellow stopper tile along the west wall; this catches the attention of Tamer Cole, and draws him away from his starting position. Spin off to the north to fight Ace Trainer Kelly in the northwest corner. Take the green spinner tiles along the north and east walls to reach the southeast corner; battle Ace Trainer Yuji and pick up the
Revive
here. Spin off westward from the entrance to the southwest corner. With Tamer Cole having moved northward to battle you, it is possible to take the nearby blue spinner tiles to reach the central area. Battle Tamer Jason and/or Black Belt Takashi, then move to the yellow stopper tile. When you do so, the lights snap on in the darkened hallway, revealing
Giovanni
and his
Persian
in the
Gym Leader
's office.
Giovanni
resumed his position as Gym Leader shortly after his defeat in
Saffron City
. He welcomes you to his hideout, where he intends to work to restore
Team Rocket
to its former glory. He is less than thrilled to see you again, but promises to hold nothing back this time!

After the battle,
Giovanni
awards you the
Earth Badge
, which ensures obedience from all Pokémon, regardless of level. As a prize, he also gives you
TM41
(
Earthquake
), a TM he claims to have made when he first acted as Gym Leader. He refuses to face his followers after this defeat, and officially disbands
Team Rocket
. He promises to devote his life to Pokémon training, and bids you farewell.
Changing of the Guard
When you exit the Gym,
Blue
is just arriving. He is shocked that a criminal would use a Pokémon Gym as their hideout, and decides to look after the
Viridian Gym
from now on. To reach the
Pokémon League
, he points you toward
Route 22
to the west.
The Path to the Summit
Having won all eight Gym Badges, the next destination is the
Indigo Plateau
, far to the northwest. The elite Trainers there are tough, but before you can challenge them, you must first survive a grueling cave known as
Victory Road
. Gather your strongest Pokémon team and visit a Poké Mart to replenish your supply of Potions and Poké Balls. A third Legendary Pokémon can be found deep inside.
