Roadmap to Adventure
Introduction
After a brief cutscene, the player is given a choice of several languages—English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese—in which to play. Once this is complete, the resident researcher of the
Kanto
region,
Professor Oak
, appears and introduces new Trainers to the Pokémon world. The player is presented with eight photos and asked to select a gender and skin tone combination for their character. Next, the player is asked to enter their name, which can be up to twelve characters long. Finally, the professor asks for the name of
your friend and rival
. With that done, the player is transported into the world of Pokémon to begin their adventure!
Pallet Town
Pallet Town
The journey begins in
Pallet Town
, in the southwest part of the
Kanto
region. It is a rather small, sleepy town with only three buildings. The western house belongs to you and
Mom
, while the eastern one is home to
your rival
and his sister. The large building to the south is
Professor Oak
's
Laboratory
. The north part of town leads to the
tall grasses
of
Route 1
, and the waters to the south open up to
Route 21
.

The journey begins in your bedroom, with you standing in front of your
Nintendo Switch
. When you try to go down the stairs, Trace comes running up to your room. Today is the day that you are each supposed to receive your
first partner Pokémon
from
Professor Oak
! He reminds you to read the email that he sent you, which includes some basic adventure tips, before excitedly running off.
1F
Mom
is standing in the kitchen, and reminds you to go and meet with
Professor Oak
. It is best not to keep him waiting, so leave the house to track him down.
A Wild Pokémon Appears!
Pallet Town
has only a few places to explore, and
Professor Oak
is nowhere to be found. There is nothing else to do around here right now, so head for the
tall grass
on the north side of town. A flock of
Pidgey
was helping the professor with his research and he lost track of time. The two of you are about to head for the lab when suddenly, a wild
Pikachu
P
/
Eevee
E
appears! Oak uses the battle to teach you how to catch a wild Pokémon.
Catching a Pokémon
The catching mechanics are very different from those in other
core series
games, and differ based on the desired control scheme.
TV Mode
When using a single Joy-Con, aim it horizontally at the TV screen. To ready a Poké Ball, press the A (or ZR) Button, raise the Joy-Con so it is held vertically, then lower it back down horizontally to throw it. If using the Left Joy-Con, press ▶︎ (or the ZL Button) instead.
Handheld Mode
When playing with both Joy-Cons attached to the Nintendo Switch, press the A (or ZL, or ZR) Button to ready the Poké Ball. Move the Switch around to aim, then press the button again to toss the Poké Ball toward the center of the screen.
Poké Ball Plus
When using the Poké Ball Plus, press the center button to ready the Poké Ball, raise it up, and then lower the accessory to toss a Poké Ball.
After the battle, the professor intends to let you nickname the newly-caught Pokémon, until its Poké Ball starts bouncing around wildly. The lively Pokémon dashes off to the lab with you and Oak in hot pursuit!
Professor Oak's Lab
Trace
is already waiting here for the professor, and says that the third Poké Ball on the table just appeared a second ago. Oak explains what had happened, then invites you to take the Poké Ball to receive your
partner Pokémon
. He offers you the chance to give it a
nickname
, which may be up to twelve characters long. Trace then chooses a second Poké Ball from the table, which contains an
Eevee
P
/ a
Pikachu
E
. Although Pikachu and Eevee are normally capable of
evolving
, this particular individual will always refuse to do so.

Normal
When you turn to leave, you are stopped by
Professor Oak
. Now that you and Trace are starting out as
Pokémon Trainers
, he has a request for each of you: take the
Pokédex
he invented and use it to gather information on all the Pokémon in the world. This handheld device is a high-tech encyclopedia that records data on every Pokémon you encounter, and will be complete when you catch a member of every species. It was Oak's dream to do this himself, but his advanced age means that he must rely on the two of you instead.
Roadmap to Adventure
Outside the lab, you find Mom waiting for you. She and your new Pokémon take a moment to get acquainted. Realizing that you are about to go on an adventure, she brought along a
Town Map
of the
Kanto
region for you. To view it, open the menu and select it from the Bag. She wishes the two of you safe travels before heading home, leaving you to begin your journey. Leave
Pallet Town
behind and head north to
Route 1
.
