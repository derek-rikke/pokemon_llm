Time for a Trade
The girl sitting on the sofa to the left of the counter is hoping to trade Pokémon. She is hoping to get a
Rattata
and is willing to part with her
Alolan
Rattata in exchange. Hers is a
Dark
/
Normal
Pokémon, so it takes extra damage from
Fighting-type
attacks but has an advantage against
Psychic-type
Pokémon. Dark-type Pokémon are few and far between in the
Kanto
region, so Alolan Rattata can make a useful addition to your team. This trade may be conducted multiple times.
A Rare Addition
Visit the house next to the Pokémon Center to find
a girl
who cares for injured and abandoned Pokémon. She has nursed a
Bulbasaur
back to health, but now it needs a caring Trainer to raise it properly. If you have caught at least 30 Pokémon, she asks if you would take care of the young Pokémon.
Gym Badge Trivia
The northwest house belongs to a man who gives a bit of trivia for each
Badge
. According to him,
Celadon Gym
's
Rainbow Badge
is the most expensive to make, and
Cinnabar Gym
's
Volcano Badge
is made from hardened lava. Most Trainers aren't sure if
Saffron Gym
's
Marsh Badge
is real gold or not!
Bike Shop
The house in the southwest part of town belongs to a man known as the Bike Maniac. He has collected several different kinds, including models like the
Acro Bike
and
Mach Bike
. Examine each one, including the bike hanging on the wall, and listen to his long-winded description of each to receive a set of 5
Heart Scales
.
Breaking, Entering
The house in the northeast is currently blocked off by
Officer Jenny
. It seems that
Team Rocket
has broken into the home and stolen
a valuable item
from its residents. Nothing can be done to remedy this at the moment, so set your sights on the Gym instead.
Cerulean Gym
Cerulean Gym
Cerulean City Pokémon Gym
Leader: Misty
The Tomboyish Mermaid
The
Cerulean Gym
specializes in
Water-type
Pokémon. Water-type moves are super effective against
Fire
-,
Ground
-, and
Rock-type
Pokémon, while Water-type Pokémon are weak to
Electric
- and
Grass-type
moves. When entering the Gym, the guide warns that
Misty
is a powerful Trainer and that all challengers must show a Pokémon of at least level 15 to proceed. With a
Pikachu
and
Bulbasaur
in tow, beating the Cerulean Gym should be an easy task. Other Grass Pokémon—
Oddish
and
Bellsprout
—can be found on the nearby
Route 24
, as well. Be sure to visit the Move Tutor in the Pokémon Center, as Pikachu's
Zippy Zap
and Eevee's
Buzzy Buzz
attacks will be a big help.
Misty
leads with her
Psyduck
. Neither of its moves are very strong, but all of the available
Grass
Pokémon up to this point have also been part-
Poison
, leaving them vulnerable to
Psychic
attacks like
Confusion
. Her
Starmie
is a bigger threat. Its high
Special Attack
lets it deal a good bit of damage with
Swift
. Not only can
Scald
sometimes cause a
Burn
, but as it matches Starmie's type, it also receives a
Same-type attack bonus
. Use your
partner Pokémon
's new
Electric
attack to take it down before it can cause too much trouble.

Rival Battle 3
When you head toward
Route 24
,
Trace
comes running toward you from the bridge. He has seen something so bewildering that all he can do is to draw you into battle. He leads with his
Pidgey
, so start off with
Electric
- and
Rock-type
attacks. His
Oddish
can
Poison
its target with a toxic powder, so use
Flying
attacks to knock it out quickly. Aside from having grown a few levels, his
Eevee
is much the same as it was in the previous battle.

Afterward, your friend manages to calm himself down and tells you of a house up ahead where a famous Pokémon fanatic is said to live. He paid a visit hoping to see some rare Pokémon, but instead of finding the homeowner, he found a talking Pokémon instead! He tries to convince you to stay away before running off.

, a bit of gold that can be sold for a high price. The man then reveals himself as a
Team Rocket
Grunt and tries to persuade you to join the group, and draws you into battle when you refuse.
A Rare Addition
Speak to
the boy
on the northwest hill. He has been thinking that he should release his
Charmander
because he is no good at raising Pokémon. If you have caught at least 50 Pokémon, he decides to give Charmander to you, instead.
Route 25

An Unfortunate Turn
The
Sea Cottage
belongs to
Bill
, a famous Pokémon researcher. When you step inside, it seems like Bill must be away, until your
partner Pokémon
notices a
Nidorino
in the corner. But it's not just any Nidorino. Bill's latest experiment has gone awry and combined his DNA with that of a Pokémon! He needs your help, so once he has stepped into the teleporter, inspect his PC to run his Cell Separation System to undo the change and return him to normal. As a token of gratitude, he gives you a pair of
S.S. Tickets
, which grant access to the
luxury cruise ship
currently docked in
Vermilion City
to the south.
Bill's Legendary Research
Before leaving the cape, you can exit and re-enter the cottage and inspect Bill's PC to read his reports on the locations of the
legendary birds
. This adds
three
new
pages
to your Pokédex.
Cerulean City
Justice, Served
Once you return to
Cerulean City
, you find a
Squirtle
running off with one of
Officer Jenny
's Poké Balls, with the officer reluctantly abandoning her post to chase it down. Step inside to find obvious signs of a break-in, like muddy footprints and broken furniture. Your
partner Pokémon
even points out a large hole in the wall! Walk out through the gap to find and confront the thief.

Pokémon Day Care
The house on the hill is the
Pokémon Day Care
. The elderly woman inside will raise one Pokémon at a time while you are away. A Pokémon left here will gain one
experience point
for every step taken. If you bought the
Magikarp
near
Mt. Moon
, this is a good way to raise it. The downside is that she will make every decision, so she may end up deleting a move you would like to keep. She charges
$
100, plus another
$
100 for every new level, to return a Pokémon.
Mr. Hyper
An elderly man known as
Mr. Hyper
can be found here, as well. He says that if you ever earn the
Champion
title, be sure to come back and visit him.
Meet Up with Trace
Trace
is waiting for you outside the
Underground Path
building. As it is impossible to reach
Saffron City
at the moment, he suggests following the tunnel to
Route 6
instead. He notices something sparkly in your hair, and gives you the
Revive
he just found before giving out a couple more to help with the next Gym. Your friend notices the two
S.S. Tickets
you have, and he happily accepts the extra ticket before entering the tunnel.
Underground Path
Many people drop items along the underground passage. Pay attention to your
partner Pokémon
, as it has a knack for noticing hidden items and will wag its tail faster as you approach them.
