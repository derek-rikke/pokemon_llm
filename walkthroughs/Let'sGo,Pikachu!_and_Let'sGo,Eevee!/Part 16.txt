Hall of Fame
Indigo Plateau
Indigo Plateau
The
Indigo Plateau
serves as the capital for the
Pokémon League
in the
Kanto
region. This is where the Trainers who have defeated all eight
Gym Leaders
battle against the
Elite Four
and the
Champion
. The entrance hall houses a Poké Mart to the west and a Pokémon Center to the east, allowing challengers to prepare themselves and their Pokémon for the gauntlet ahead. The Elite Four is a group of talented Pokémon Trainers second only to the Champion in terms of power, and must be fought in succession with no break. These five battles will not be easy, but challengers who bring their strongest Pokémon and a healthy supply of Potions and Revives may finally find themselves in the
Hall of Fame
.
Time for a Trade
The Super Nerd standing to the west near the Poké Mart counter is looking to trade Pokémon. He is hoping to get an
Exeggutor
and is willing to part with his
Alolan
Exeggutor in exchange. His is a
Grass
/
Dragon
Pokémon, a unique typing not seen anywhere else. This trade may be conducted multiple times.
Madame Memorial
Speak to the woman near the Pokémon Center to meet a woman who goes by the name
Madame Memorial
. In exchange for one
Heart Scale
at a time, she can teach a Pokémon any move it can learn in its current form by leveling up. Equip your Pokémon with powerful moves before challenging the Elite Four!
Elite Four
Battle 1
Lorelei's room
The first member of the Elite Four is
Lorelei
, a master
Ice-type
Trainer and the same woman who helped you chase of the
Team Rocket
Grunts on
Route 10
. She welcomes you to the
Pokémon League
and reintroduces herself. Ice-type moves are super effective against
Grass
-,
Flying
-,
Ground
-, and
Dragon-type
Pokémon, while Ice-type Pokémon are weak to
Fire
-,
Fighting
-,
Rock
-, and
Steel-type
moves. Her
Jynx
is notably her only Pokémon that is not
Water
type. Due to her Pokémon's dual typings,
Electric
moves are the most useful against Lorelei's frigid forces.

Defeating Lorelei opens the door to the second room.
Battle 2
Bruno's room
The second member of the Elite Four is
Bruno
, a master
Fighting-type
Trainer. Fighting-type moves are super effective against
Normal
-,
Rock
-,
Ice
-,
Dark
-, and
Steel-type
Pokémon, while Fighting-type Pokémon are weak to
Flying
-,
Psychic
-, and
Fairy-type
moves. Bruno leads with his
Onix
, which makes
Grass
and
Water
moves helpful, as well.
Slowbro
and
Starmie
may be especially useful here, as their
Water
/
Psychic
typing helps to counter each opposing Pokémon.

Battle 3
Agatha's room
The third member of the Elite Four is
Agatha
, a master
Ghost-type
Trainer. Ghost-type moves are super effective against Ghost- and
Psychic-type
Pokémon, while Ghost-type Pokémon are weak to Ghost- and
Dark-type
moves.
Normal
- and
Fighting-type
moves will have no effect. Despite being a Ghost type specialist, only two of her Pokémon are Ghosts; however, as all of her Pokémon share the
Poison
type,
Ground
- and
Psychic-type
attacks are the best ways to calm Agatha's spirits.

Defeating Agatha unlocks the door to the fourth room.
Battle 4
Lance's room
The fourth and final member of the Elite Four is
Lance
, a master
Dragon-type
Trainer and leader of the Elite Four. Dragon-type moves are super effective against Dragon-type Pokémon, while Dragon-type Pokémon are weak to Dragon-,
Ice
-, and
Fairy-type
moves. They also resist
Grass
-,
Fire
-,
Water
-, and
Electric-type
attacks. All of Lance's Pokémon have a draconic appearance, but only one is Dragon type. He leads with his
Seadra
, so Grass and Electric moves are best. Due to its secondary
Flying
type, his
Aerodactyl
also takes serious damage from Ice moves, but Water moves are also effective. His
Gyarados
takes massive damage from Electric moves, so use
Thunderbolt
to take it down. Use
Ice Beam
or
Outrage
to take down his
Dragonite
. With their Ice and Electric attacks,
Articuno
and
Zapdos
are some of the best choices to help slay Lance's dragons.

When
Lance
is defeated, he tells you that there is one more Trainer to face. Before he can reveal their identity,
Professor Oak
enters and congratulates you on defeating the
Elite Four
. Lance continues, telling you that
Trace
defeated the Pokémon League before you, and the
Champion
title rests with him. Oak explains that in the past, merely defeating the Elite Four earned a Trainer the Champion title. However, this position has recently been established as part of the Pokémon League, so you must defeat the previous one to claim the title. Lance explains that the professor is here to officiate the crowning of the new Champion. It's fitting that it would be one of you, the Trainers who took care of
Team Rocket
!
Once the conversation is over, take a moment to prepare your Pokémon, as you will be drawn into battle soon after entering the next room.
Champion
Champion's room
Trace
is happy to see that you have made it here as well, and is glad that his first opponent as
Champion
is you. The battle for the Champion's title is about to begin!
Trace leads with his
Pidgeot
and immediately triggers its
Mega Evolution
; this greatly enhances its
Special Attack
and
Speed
. It is best to lead with an
Electric
or
Rock
Pokémon to counter it.
Vileplume
's strongest move is
Solar Beam
, although it takes one turn to charge before attacking. It is vulnerable to several different types, and so should be fairly easy to knock out. His
Marowak
takes serious damage from
Grass
and
Water
moves, but Grass Pokémon should be wary of
Fire Punch
! Like Marowak,
Rapidash
is vulnerable to Water moves, as well as
Rock
and
Ground
attacks.
Flare Blitz
deals a major amount of damage but leaves the user injured, as well. As with Pidgeot, his
Slowbro
cannot last very long against Electric moves. Its
Special Defense
is lower than its physical
Defense
, so use Special attacks before it can use
Light Screen
. Finally, his
Jolteon
P
/
Raichu
E
takes super effective damage only from Ground attacks. Send in a Ground Pokémon like
Dugtrio
, and his partner Pokémon will resort to using its weaker moves. Raichu's
Iron Tail
can deal serious damage to Rock Pokémon, so avoid using
Rhyhorn
or
Onix
!

The eight
Gym Leaders
are defeated, the
Elite Four
have fallen, and the title of
Champion
has been snatched away from your rival!
Professor Oak
appears and congratulates you on your victory, and both you and
Trace
for having a great battle. The professor leads you from the hall, and the game is saved.
Hall of Fame
It is here where all victorious Trainers and their dedicated Pokémon will be recorded, as a testament to their power and perseverance. Once the professor enters your team's information, the credits begin to roll...
But the adventure is not over just yet. When you return to
Pallet Town
, you automatically head for home while your
partner Pokémon
excitedly gathers a bunch of flowers. The screen goes black and
The End
appears before the game saves your progress.
