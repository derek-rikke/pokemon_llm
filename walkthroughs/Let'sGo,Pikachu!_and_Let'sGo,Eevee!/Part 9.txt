, and is willing to part with its
Alolan
counterpart in exchange. His Sandshrew is an

Pokémon when it evolves. Both are unique typings not seen outside of these evolutionary families. This trade may be conducted multiple times.
Fortune Teller
A Channeler named Madam Celadon and her
Abra
can be found to the left of the front desk. For
$
10,000, she can influence the
Nature
of any wild Pokémon you might encounter for the rest of the day. Nature is determined with two questions; the first question determining the Nature's strength, and the second determining its weakness.

Celadon Condominiums
The tall building in the north part of town is the
Celadon Condominiums
.
Brock
can be seen standing outside the entrance and calls out to you when you approach. He intended to visit the local
Gym Leader
, but was turned away and is now headed home. He gives you a bag of
Pewter Crunchies
he'd brought as a gift, as well as a cup of
Tea
. He wishes you the best and leaves toward the east.
On the third floor,
Game Freak
's game director promises a
reward
for showing him your completed
Pokédex
. There is also a female Ace Trainer nearby who asks that you return once you have earned a title.
Celadon Department Store
The
Celadon Department Store
is the largest shop in
Kanto
. Nearly any item a Trainer could want can be found here.
2F
The Trainers' Market is found on the second floor. Everyday items like
Great Balls
and
Super Potions

Celadon Gym
Celadon Gym
Celadon City Pokémon Gym
Leader: Erika
The Nature-Loving Princess
The
Celadon Gym
specializes in
Grass-type
Pokémon. This type is generally vulnerable against
Fire
-,
Ice
-,
Flying
-,
Poison
-, and
Bug-type
attacks. Most Pokémon inside are also part-Poison, which leaves them exposed to
Psychic
moves, as well.
Water
,
Rock
, and
Ground
Pokémon are best kept on the sidelines. Grass Pokémon tend to harass their target with status ailments, so it is a good idea to bring healing items like
Antidote
,
Paralyze Heal
, and
Awakening
. The Gym is decorated like a hedge maze. A Lass stops you near the entrance and explains that only Trainers with cute Pokémon are allowed to enter. Show her an acceptable Pokémon from your party, like Pikachu or Eevee, to gain entry.
Go straight ahead from the entrance to see
Erika
watching you from above the ledge. Turn right to battle Lass Kay and continue eastward. Clearing the southern bush only leads back to the entrance, so use
Chop Down
on the other bush and head north instead. Go right to battle Beauty Mai, then follow the path to the building's northeast area. Fight Picnicker Tina and Beauty Tamia to reach another intersection. Chopping down the bush on the right creates another shortcut to the entrance, so go left instead to battle Beauty Lori in the building's northwest corner. Head south to fight Ace Trainer Mary, then battle Lass Lina near another intersection. Cut down the bush on the right and continue on. Chop down the final bush on the left to reach the Gym Leader.

After the battle,
Erika
awards you the
Rainbow Badge
, which ensures obedience from all Pokémon up to level 50. She also gives you
TM53
(
Mega Drain
) as a prize.
Shady Dealings
Next door to the restaurant, there are
Team Rocket
Grunts organizing the transport of Pokémon to the Game Corner to be used as prizes. As one of the Grunts points out, their plan surely has nothing to do with a hidden switch in the Game Corner.
Game Corner
A Secret Switch?
Jessie and James
can be found playing some of the arcade games on the west side of the building. James is ready to leave for their hideout but Jessie is in no rush, as they have already handed
Cubone
off to another Team Rocket member. She asks James to remind her of how to enter the hideout and James rather loudly does so. Speak to the Team Rocket Grunt guarding the poster near the counter and he picks a fight with you. Defeat his Pokémon and he retreats, leaving the poster unguarded. Inspect it to push a switch hidden underneath. A loud noise echoes as a hidden door opens to the left, revealing a secret stairway leading underground.
Team Rocket Hideout
The
Team Rocket Hideout
is a secret underground complex used by the group as their base of operations. Rumors point to a
certain item
being located somewhere in
Celadon
that can identify the ghosts of
Pokémon Tower
. It would not be surprising for
Team Rocket
to have acquired an item as valuable as this, so be sure to take it back if you can find it!

Visit the western room to get a set of 5

. The female Team Rocket Grunt to the south of the entrance is actually a spy, and gives you the
Team Rocket Set
of clothing to mark your encounter. Defeat the last Team Rocket Grunt and collect the 3
Mighty Candies
from the east room, then take the stairs down to B2F.
B2F
Go west to fight the next Team Rocket Grunt. Further west is a maze of
spinner tiles
meant to thwart any intruders; step on one of these arrow tiles to be sent spinning until you reach a stopper tile.
Enter the maze and follow the spinner tiles to the stopper tile in the northwest. Backtrack carefully to reach a
Nugget
in the northeast corner. Collect the
Awakening
,
TM05
(
Rest
), and
PP Up
on the way southward. Step on the northern of the two southernmost spinner tiles to reach the maze exit and climb the stairs to the east.
B1F (West)
Battle the two Rocket Grunts here, then pick up the
Hyper Potion
to the west and the set of 5
Great Balls
to the east.
B2F
Backtrack through the east side of the maze and head down the stairs to the north.
B3F
Go south past the lone Rocket Grunt to reach
TM20
(
Dark Pulse
), then head west to grab the
Revive
in the floor's northwest corner and enter the second maze of spinner tiles. Collect the
X Speed
and
Rare Candy
on the way southward, then battle another Rocket Grunt and go downstairs.
B4F (Northwest)
Go west to reach a
Hyper Potion
and a
PP Up
, then continue north. Another Rocket Grunt can be found in the north room. It's his fault that the elevator isn't working, because he has the Lift Key!
Even when defeated, he still refuses to give it up. He runs off and throws the key into the metal grating overhead to prevent you from reaching the boss. Examine the blue chair from the desk to move it underneath the vent in the northeast part of the room. Examine the chair again to help your
partner Pokémon
up into the vent. Take control of the Pokémon and go northwest to reach another metal grate; examine it to walk out onto the overhead pipes. Loop around along the metal grating to reach the
Lift Key
to the southeast.
Jessie and James
are standing guard in the next room and hear your Pokémon's movements, but believe it to be from Meowth's stomach making noise. Move to the edge of the grating to have your Pokémon jump down and reunite with you.
Climb back up to B2F and make your way through the larger maze again to reach the elevator. Take it down to B4F.
B4F (Southeast)
Go west to reach an
Elixir
, then head north to confront
Jessie and James
.
Soon after exiting the elevator, you are confronted by
Jessie and James
. They intend to get payback for their defeat at
Mt. Moon
, and draw you into battle.

Giovanni accepts his defeat, and acknowledges that you raise your Pokémon with great care. He allows you to take Cubone with you, and gives you the
Silph Scope
as an apology for mocking you. He says that a child like you could never understand his goals, and leaves the room. Cubone takes the opportunity to make its way back to
Lavender Town
. Ride the elevator back to B1F to reach the exit.
Fly, Fly Away
When you leave the Game Corner, be sure to speak to the
Rocker
in front of the building. He's invented a machine with balloons attached that lets the user fly through the sky, and teaches your
partner Pokémon
a new
Secret Technique
, Sky Dash. Use this to instantly fly back to
Lavender Town
.
Lavender Town
Pokémon Tower
The
Ghost
Pokémon of
Pokémon Tower
are immune to
Normal
- and
Fighting-type
attacks, and are vulnerable to Ghost- and
Dark-type
moves. The spirits can be relentless, so it may be useful to bring a supply of Repels along to avoid them as much as possible. There are still many possessed Channelers here as well, so be sure to bring some Super Potions along to keep your Pokémon in good health.

Go northeast to battle Channeler Ruth and grab the
Nugget
near the north wall. A Channeler in the middle of the floor has not been possessed and maintains a healing area with her white magic. When a Trainer enters this protected zone, all of their Pokémon will be fully healed. Continue south to battle Channeler Karina and pick up the

.
Cubone
rushes in and tries to reach for its mother, but her spirit is calmed and she crosses over to the afterlife. Trace attempts to comfort the Pokémon, then tells you that he'll see that it gets home. He asks that you continue on and help
Mr. Fuji
get home, as well. Go south to grab a
Rare Candy
and climb the southern stairs.
7F
Upon reaching the top floor, you find
Mr. Fuji
standing before an altar.
Jessie and James
rush past you. With Marowak's spirit calmed, they are now here to persuade Mr. Fuji to provide his research to
Team Rocket
. They can't risk you thwarting their plans again, and draw you into battle. Their
Ekans
and
Koffing
have evolved since the previous battle. Use
Ground
- and
Psychic-type
moves like before for greatest effect.

Afterward, Jessie tells James that they can make up for their defeat by helping with the takeover of
Silph Co.
in
Saffron City
. After they blast off again, speak to
Mr. Fuji
. Having not even noticed Jessie and James's presence, he thanks you for calming Marowak's spirit and asks that you accompany him to his home, Pokémon House, at the foot of the tower.
Pokémon House
Speak to
Mr. Fuji
to receive the
Poké Flute
as thanks. This instrument awakens any
sleeping
Pokémon who may hear its music. With this, you can finally wake the two
Snorlax
who have been blocking the way to southern
Kanto
. But first, head west to return to
Saffron City
to chase off the Rockets and take on the next Gym.
