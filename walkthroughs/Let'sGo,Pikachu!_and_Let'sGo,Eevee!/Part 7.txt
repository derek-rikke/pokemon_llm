Strive for Success
Visit the
gate
on the route's east side and speak to the Scientist. He happens to be one of
Professor Oak
's
aides
and has been tasked with evaluating your
Pokédex
progress. If you have caught at least 30 different species, he rewards you by unlocking the
Judge function
. This can be used at any time from a Pokémon's status screen to view its
battle potential
.
Diglett's Cave
Diglett's Cave
is a long tunnel that spans nearly the whole region, linking

Let There Be Light
One of
Oak
's
aides
is waiting for you near the house outside
Diglett's Cave
. He has a trick to demonstrate for you, but invites you inside as it is too bright for it outdoors. As a reward for capturing at least 10 different species, he teaches your
partner Pokémon
a new
Secret Technique
, Light Up. This move makes it easier to navigate the dark interior of
certain underground areas
.
Meet Up with Trace
When you step outside, you run into
Trace
again. He is surprised that it was your partner Pokémon who has learned Light Up instead of you, and mentions someplace where you may be able to put it to use. He offers to take you there; if you decide to travel with him, he leads you back to the east side of
Cerulean City
.
Pewter City
Pewter Museum of Science
On this latest visit to
Pewter City
, you can use
Chop Down
to clear the small tree on the northeast hill to reach the employee-only area of the
museum
. Speak to the Scientist standing next to the table to receive the
Old Amber
. There are Scientists elsewhere who have apparently developed a way to regenerate Pokémon from ancient bits of DNA like this.
Fork in the Road
If you did not take Trace's offer to travel together, the next step is to return to
Cerulean City
. There are two ways to get back there: either travel east through
Mt. Moon
again, or hike back through
Diglett's Cave
and head north from
Vermilion City
. Once back in Cerulean City, make your way to the east side of town and use
Chop Down
to clear the small tree and continue eastward.

Route 9
is a rocky, uneven mountain road that links

Ambush!
When you try to move south past the Pokémon Center, you are stopped by a
Team Rocket
Grunt. He recognizes you as the person who continues to thwart the group's plans, and calls over two more Grunts. A fourth appears from behind the building, blocking your escape. They hold you responsible for ruining Team Rocket's reputation and plan to get their revenge. As the Grunts close in, a red-haired woman passing by on her
Lapras
steps in. She cannot forgive ganging up on a child and takes on three of the Grunts, leaving only one left for you to battle.
The three Grunts are dumbfounded. Even outnumbered, the woman defeats them with ease. She introduces herself as
Lorelei
of the
Elite Four
and threatens to freeze them all solid with her powerful
Ice-type
Pokémon, scaring them off in a hurry. She notices that you are collecting Gym Badges, and looks forward to the day when you challenge the
Pokémon League
.
