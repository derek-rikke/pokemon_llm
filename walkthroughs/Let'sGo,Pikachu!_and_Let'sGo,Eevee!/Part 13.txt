Cinnabar Island
Cinnabar Island
Cinnabar
is a large island to the southwest of mainland
Kanto
, between Routes
20
and
21
. The
Cinnabar Lab
, where researchers have developed a way to revive ancient Pokémon, stands to the west. A broken-down building known as
Pokémon Mansion
is located on the island's northwest side. The
Cinnabar Gym
can be found to the northeast, but is currently locked up tight.

Time for a Trade
A Punk Guy to the right of the counter is looking to trade Pokémon. He wants to get a
Grimer
P
/
Meowth
E
and is willing to part with its
Alolan
counterpart in exchange. Alolan Grimer is a
Poison
/
Dark
Pokémon, while Alolan Meowth is a
Dark-type
Pokémon. Dark types are few and far between in the Kanto region, so either one can make a useful addition to your team. This trade may be conducted multiple times.
Cinnabar Lab
Reception Room
In the Reception Room, Scientists meet visitors to the lab and unwind when they are not working.
Research Room
In the Research Room, speak to the Scientist seated at the desk to receive
TM02
(
Taunt
). When used, Taunt lures the target into using only damaging moves.
Testing Room
Fossil Regeneration
The Scientist near the back wall runs the
fossil
regeneration procedure. Speak to him to hand over the
Helix Fossil
,
Dome Fossil
, or
Old Amber
. The procedure only takes a moment to complete, and you soon receive the ancient Pokémon. The Helix Fossil and Dome Fossil become
Omanyte
and
Kabuto
, respectively; both are
Rock
/
Water
Pokémon that swam the primordial seas. The Old Amber becomes the
Rock
/
Flying
Aerodactyl
, a terror of the prehistoric skies.

Pokémon Mansion
The
Pokémon Mansion
is the decrepit, burned-out former home of a famous Pokémon researcher. The building uses several hidden switches to lock and unlock doors, and Burglars prowl the ruins for valuable items. A series of
journal entries
can be found scattered around the mansion that describe the birth and escape of
a genetically-engineered Pokémon
.

TM52
(
Sludge Bomb

Max Elixir
near the large glass container in the northwest room. The

Cinnabar Gym
Cinnabar Gym
Cinnabar Island Pokémon Gym
Leader: Blaine
The Hot-Headed Quiz Master
The
Cinnabar Gym
specializes in
Fire-type
Pokémon. Fire-type moves are super effective against
Grass
-,
Bug
-,
Ice
-, and
Steel-type
Pokémon, while Fire-type Pokémon are weak to
Water
-,
Rock
-, and
Ground-type
moves. When playing with fire there is always the chance of getting
Burned
, so be sure to bring some
Burn Heals
.
Upon entering the building, you are greeted by the
Gym guide
. He is about to explain the Gym but is interrupted by an old man, who excitedly tries to quiz you right off the bat. The guide reminds him that it's not yet his turn, and
Blaine
takes his place farther ahead. There is no requirement to challenge the
Cinnabar Gym
, as the guide says that finding the
Secret Key
was difficult enough.
The
Gym Leader
is always thinking up ways to keep the families of the Scientists who work on the island from getting bored.
Blaine
enjoys riddles and has designed his Gym as a quiz show, complete with stage and TV cameras. Speak to him at the end of the red carpet to begin his Pokémon Quiz. Challengers are asked five questions, with each correct response earning them a Blaine doll that appears on the stage. Incorrect answers mean a battle with one of his students, who also give out a doll when defeated. Collect five Blaine dolls to challenge the Gym Leader!

After the battle,
Blaine
awards you the
Volcano Badge
, which ensures obedience of all Pokémon up to level 80. He also gives you
TM46
(
Fire Blast
) as a prize.
When you leave the Gym,
Trace
is standing near the sign. He congratulates you on your victory, and reminds you that you need eight to reach the
Pokémon League
. Only one more to go! Even though it was locked up the last time you visited, he suggests checking out the
Gym
back in
Viridian City
.
With the Cinnabar Gym defeated, surf north from the pier to reach
Route 21
.
Route 21
Route 21
Route 21
is an ocean route that leads from
Cinnabar Island
back to
Pallet Town
. A single patch of tall grass grows just outside of town.
