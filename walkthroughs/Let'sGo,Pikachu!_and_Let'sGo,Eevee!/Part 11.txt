Roadblock
A
Snorlax
has fallen asleep near the gate, blocking the path. Use the
Poké Flute
to wake the Pokémon. Just then,
Mr. Fuji
approaches you with something he forgot to mention. He says that Snorlax are dangerous when they first awaken, as they are hungry and likely to attack anything they perceive as food. Fuji suggests calming it down by battling it with your own Pokémon; once docile, the Pokémon can be captured like any other. Snorlax are hard to find, so catch it if you can.

Time for a Trade
The Gentleman standing to the left of the counter is hoping to trade Pokémon. He would like to get a
Marowak
and is willing to part with his
Alolan
Marowak in exchange. His is a
Fire
/
Ghost
Pokémon, a unique typing not normally seen in the
Kanto
region. This trade may be conducted multiple times.
Safari Zone warden's house
The southeastern house belongs to
the Safari Zone warden
. It is difficult to understand what he is saying, but seems to have misplaced his set of
Gold Teeth
. If you happen to find a set of false teeth, be sure to return it to him.
Fuchsia Gym
Fuchsia Gym
Fuchsia City Pokémon Gym
Leader: Koga
The Poisonous Ninja Master
The
Fuchsia Gym
officially specializes in
Poison-type
Pokémon, although there are several
Ghost
Pokémon inside, as well. Poison-type moves are super effective against
Grass
- and
Fairy-type
Pokémon, while Poison-type Pokémon are weak to
Ground
- and
Psychic-type
moves. On the first visit, the
Gym guide
explains that just as the Safari Zone gives people a chance to meet many different Pokémon, Trainers who challenge the Fuchsia Gym must also have met many Pokémon. Only those who have caught at least 50 different species may enter the building. The man drops his disguise to reveal the
Gym Leader
, who promises a tough battle before disappearing in a cloud of smoke, only to reappear in the room's center.
The Gym Leader is trained in the skills of the ninja, and has installed a series of nearly invisible glass panels to disorient any challengers. Anyone looking to battle the Gym Leader must first find the path between these panels to reach the middle of the room. Fortunately, the smoke that rises from the floor helps to identify which path to take.
Koga
's team includes
Bug
and Poison Pokémon, so
Fire
-,
Flying
-, and
Rock
attacks will also be effective. His Pokémon tend to inflict severe poisoning with
Toxic
before stalling for time with
Protect
, so be sure to bring along some
Antidotes
.
